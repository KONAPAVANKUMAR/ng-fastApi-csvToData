The captured CO2 will be ‘pipeline ready’ for geological storage and analysis of the project socio-economic impact will also be part of the study. The US Department of Energy’s National Energy Technology Laboratory awarded US$4m to the Prairie Research Institute at the University of Illinois to work on the project in early October 2021. LafargeHolcim and Air Liquide are also making cost share contributions.
The design will use Air Liquide’s Crycocap FG system at the cement plant. LafargeHolcim US says that it combines pressure swing adsorption capabilities with cryogenic refrigeration technologies to achieve high CO2 capture rates with high CO2 purity rates. Notably, for a carbon capture project, the Ste.

In conjunction with partner Helmholtz-Zentrum hereon GmbH (Hereon), the companies plan to build a carbon dioxide (CO2) capture plant at Holcim’s Hover cement works near Hannover.
The plant will harness Hereon’s PolyActive membrane technology, which uses a selective barrier material that filters some gases but allows through CO2. The low-cost solution is passive and requires less energy, in addition to being easily scalable, providing a suitable option for retrofitting or ‘end of pipe’ projects.
With cement production contributing to 8% of the world’s annual CO2 emissions, the location of the plant is no coincidence.
“Cement will remain an important building material for centuries to come so decarbonising its manufacture is a key part of achieving net zero,” said Andrew Corner, Managing Director, CPT.
“The technology being provided by CPT and Hereon will capture more than 90% of CO2 emitted at Hover.”
Carbon capture is seen as a ‘must’ for cement plants in the near future, with scalability of the technology being seen as a priority.
“The membrane approach of CPT is a promising solution,” said Arne Stecher, Head of Decarbonisation, Holcim. “Therefore, we and our partners are on the way to improve the level of technical readiness dramatically.”
Scheduled for start-up in Q2 2023, the first phase of the project will capture 5,600 tonnes per annum (tpa) of CO2, scaling up throughout the project’s lifetime with the final phase aiming to capture over 90% of emissions, delivering the CO2 in liquid form for use or storage.

LafargeHolcim, Lafarge Canada spotlight low-carbon mix designs
December 14, 2021December 14, 2021 Concrete News
Traditionally carbon intensive, the cement industry is seeing a significant change in how specifiers, architects and customers are looking at building materials through the lens of environmental impact. In response to demand for products with a lower carbon footprint, Lafarge and LafargeHolcim concrete operations in Canada and the United States have partnered to raise awareness that environmentally-friendly, cement-based products are a reality. Across North America, company officials note, market demand for and adoption of widely available binders exhibiting lower carbon dioxide emissions footprints than portland cement remains inconsistent. Decisions around material selection are generally left up to local specifiers, who set the construction standards, and customers, who have deep experience with limited product mixes.
The OneWay Forward campaign highlights five concrete production or engineering community leaders who are advocating for the use of environmentally friendly materials, specifically the Lafarge and LafargeHolcim OneCem portland-limestone cement (PLC) offering, across a variety of applications. While ordinary portland cement typically comprises 90-100 percent clinker—the product of carbon-intensive pyroprocessing—PLC bears up to 15 percent finely ground limestone. The latter imparts performance comparable to clinker-only cement, yet exhibits a lower net CO2 profile.
“Concrete is the most widely-consumed material after water, and so we consider it our responsibility to do everything we can to lower the carbon footprint of the cement we produce,” says Holcim AG Region Head North America René Thibault. “Our goal is to educate and encourage architects, engineers, contractors and ready-mix producers to adopt more sustainable products in order to lower the industry’s carbon footprint. We owe it to ourselves, future generations, and the communities where we live to maximize the use of low carbon cement wherever we can. This is how we build now.”

The decision is a monumental step in the industry’s efforts to provide low-carbon materials and solutions.
OneCem®, a product under Envirocore™ Cements – the company’s portfolio of blended hydraulic cements and supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) – is a blended cement manufactured with up to fifteen percent per ton of finely ground limestone. OneCem has been rigorously tested and proven to serve as an effective alternative for ordinary Portland cement (OPC) and is a durable, high-performance concrete that lowers the carbon footprint, thereby decreasing greenhouse gas emissions.
The Holcim Midlothian plant, which will fully convert to OneCem, is capable of producing two million tons of cement per year. By incorporating the low-carbon product into its operations, the Texas-based plant will reduce CO2 by 70 million pounds each year – the equivalent of powering 5,800 homes for one year. The plant has been a vital member of the community since 1987, contributing to nationally recognized projects across the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex, including the Perot Museum, the Margaret Hunt Hill Bridge and DFW Airport.
“This is an important, but not unique, step for us. We were the first to produce OneCem, a PLC product, in one of the fastest-growing metro areas in the country, and fuel our industry’s step towards a zero carbon future,” said Patrick Cleary, senior vice president of sales, US Cement, LafargeHolcim. “OneCem is one way we’re supporting customers who are using every tool at their disposal. In Texas and beyond, ready-mix producers are taking enormous strides and embracing more sustainable solutions with obvious environmental and performance benefits.”
The introduction of this product will reduce the industry’s carbon footprint caused by the energy intensiveness and generation of CO2 inherent in cement manufacturing.
“LafargeHolcim has gone on record with our net-zero commitment, and while we’re actively investing in technology and innovations to help us get there, it’s also crucial that we take immediate steps to reduce our carbon footprint,” said Toufic Tabbara, CEO, US Cement, LafargeHolcim. “Transitioning the operational focus at our Holcim Midlothian plant to OneCem reflects our confidence in this product and in the growing customer demand for solutions that help them achieve their own sustainability goals.”
OneCem provides the same level of performance as OPC in terms of concrete workability, set time, durability and strength development. The product can be incorporated into a broad spectrum of applications that will support foundational structures connecting every city and community in the United States. OneCem is available in the Western and Southern regions of the United States, and the company plans to rapidly expand production.

FMC signatories in carbon-intensive sectors running on hard-to-abate manufacturing or production processes will initially: Define purchasing commitments for emerging technologies geared to attaining net-zero carbon operation by 2050; secure commitments to jumpstart action this decade with an eye toward meeting 2030 benchmarks; and, facilitate purchasing commitment implementation.
Cemex S.A.B. de C.V. and Holcim AG are First Movers Coalition (FMC) founding members, joining Amazon, Apple and nearly two dozen other major companies to accelerate development of early-stage decarbonization technologies through procurement and supply chain management practices. FMC will work across eight key sectors, seven of which—cement, steel, aluminum, chemicals, shipping, aviation and trucking—account for more than a third of global carbon emissions, but presently lack cost-competitive energy alternatives to fossil fuels.
“Technology has given us the tools to reduce our emissions and build a stronger economy. For innovators and investors to play their part in tackling the climate crisis, they need clear market demand,” observes World Economic Forum (WEF) President Børge Brende. “The First Movers Coalition will leverage the collective purchasing power of leading companies and drive the need for these technologies.”
FMC launched at the United Nations-aligned COP26 summit in Glasgow as a partnership between WEF and the U.S. Office of the Special Presidential Envoy for Climate. It musters global business leaders to create near-term market demand for zero carbon solutions, and becomes the only buyers club working to scale new technologies across heavy industry and heavy-duty transport sectors. Coalition members underscore the importance of new and emerging technologies, which the International Energy Agency credits for about half of the emissions reduction measures aimed at keeping global temperature increase, through 2050, under 1.5°C versus pre-industrial levels.
“The net-zero transition requires unprecedented collaboration across value chains. The First Movers Coalition can achieve this,” says Holcim CEO Jan Jenisch. “Together we can grow the demand for net-zero solutions to drive more investment in next-generation green technologies. As a founding member, Holcim is committed to taking action on both the demand and supply sides. We will buy more net-zero vehicles and continue to grow our range of green building solutions to scale up net-zero construction.”
“Cemex is committed to lead on the road to carbon neutrality,” affirms CEO Fernando Gonzalez. “We are proud to join forces with the World Economic Forum and other global companies to accelerate development of critical new decarbonizing technologies.” Under its Future in Action program, he adds, Cemex has outlined the most aggressive 2030 decarbonization goals in the heavy building materials industry, and is pursuing delivery of net zero carbon dioxide concrete globally by 2050.
In an early indicator of net zero-rooted procurement strategies, Cemex and Holcim have teamed with fellow First Movers Coalition charter member Volvo Group on deployment of electric battery-powered on-, on/off- and off-road equipment. — www.weforum.org/first-movers-coalition
POLICIES REDUCE CO2 EMISSIONS TONNAGE
Urgent government and industry action in three key areas could save around 900 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions annually by 2030, the World Cement Association, London, contends: Promote a market for low-carbon concrete by encouraging its use in publicly-funded construction; review and update product standards to allow low-carbon concrete to be used in a wider range of applications; and, create the right market incentives for developing and using low-carbon cement and concrete technologies via carbon pricing, subsidies or other economic mechanisms.
In a session at last month’s COP26 United Nations climate summit in Scotland, WCA CEO Ian Riley addressed the three immediate actions governments around the world can take to significantly accelerate the cement and concrete industry’s progress towards net zero and beyond. For an industry that contributes around 7 percent of global carbon emissions, he cited the need to decarbonize quickly as critical if worldwide efforts to reduce and reverse global heating are to succeed. A net-zero cement industry is not only achievable, he noted, new technologies for carbon-negative concrete are emerging that can remove CO2 that is already in the atmosphere. If governments the world over respond to WCA’s call and act now, annual emissions of CO2 from cement and concrete could drop 30 percent by 2030.
“The pathways to net zero will be different for every cement plant. However, there are a few key measures which governments can adopt that will have a rapid and lasting impact on the pace of global uptake of all these measures,” Riley observed.

ZURICH, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Holcim (HOLN.S) is ready to make more acquisitions to expand its fast-growing solutions and products business, the world's largest cement maker said on Thursday, as it announced its 2025 goals.
Holcim wants to expand the share of the division - which makes pre-cast concretes, roofing products, asphalt and dry mortars - to 30% of its sales, helping to broaden its business.
In 2020, the division represented 8.2% of its sales, although since then Holcim has bought Firestone Building Products, a roofing products business, for $3.4 billion, its biggest deal in more than a decade. read more

""Roofing sales are already delivering double-digit growth in the $50 billion global flat roofing market and will double to $4 billion by 2025 with strategic investments and acquisitions,"" Holcim said.
The drive will help improve Holcim's environmental profile as many products like roofing reduce energy loss from buildings.
The expansion was one of several new targets Holcim unveiled ahead of its investor day on Thursday after the Swiss company achieved its 2022 targets a year early.
""With our new level of performance, we have the firepower to invest in Solutions & Products,"" Chief Executive Jan Jenisch said in a statement.
Holcim, which generates most of its sales from cement, concrete and aggregates, is aiming for group annual sales to increase by 3% to 5% after currency movements and portfolio changes.
The goal is the same as the company had targeted in its 2022 strategy. Holcim is also aiming to increase its recurring operating profit at a faster rate than sales.
Holcim, formerly known as LafargeHolcim, plans to spend 500 million Swiss francs ($539 million) on 'green capex,' the company said, with increased spending on projects like carbon capture at its plants and recycling more of it materials.
Holcim has previously been bullish about its prospects, saying it expected a period of abnormally strong demand as economies bounce back from the pandemic and government infrastructure packages support building projects.
But concerns about its carbon footprint have deterred many investors, with its share price rising only 3.5% in the last 12 months, compared with a 26.3% gain by the broader European construction materials sector. (.SXOP)

And it is doing something different that could eventually impact the entire world.
The Midlothian plant produces cement. In case, you have always used the terms interchangeably, you should know, producers of cement say it is like the flour in a cake recipe. Once mixed with other ingredients, it becomes a batter that is used to produce a cake—which would be the concrete in this metaphor.
And producers have been using the same ""cake"" recipe for a long time, says Holcim Senior Vice President of Cement Sales Patrick Cleary.
""We have been doing the old Portland cement recipe for 100 plus years. And now, we are looking to rapidly change the way we construct…change the way we build,"" said Cleary.
Cleary said his industry recognizes it needs to make big changes. If you didn't know, cement produces a lot of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide. Making a pound of cement produces .9 pounds of CO2, according to cement.org. That happens because of a reaction when the components of cement are super-heated.
""We don't hide from it. Cement manufacturing is a large contributor to CO2. But we also have a huge opportunity to be a huge part of the solution,"" said Cleary.
Cleary said not only is his company the largest cement producer in the U.S., they're also, ""The first ones to announce a net zero pledge -- net zero by 2050.""
To become carbon neutral, they have moved to a new kind of cement, called OneCem.
Holcim said because it includes “up to 15% per ton of finely ground high quality limestone”, it produces about 10% less carbon dioxide than typical cement.
Holcim is transitioning its 14 U.S. plants to this product, including Midlothian, which is, ""The first plant in the country to do this transition.""
A 10% reduction in carbon dioxide is modest. But multiply that by the two million tons of cement Holcim produces in Midlothian each year, and the change starts to add up.
“We have to look at taking a baby step at first, but we can’t slow down the acceleration,"" said Cleary.
Cleary said the company is already working on the next mixture that might produce a 30% CO2 reduction. So, Cleary said, this is the first of many steps to cleaner concrete.
And that concrete is already being used in some parts of North Texas.
“You won’t even be able to see it, in fact, we already have nearly a million tons of this cement in concrete today in and around the Dallas-Fort Worth market,"" said Cleary.
Some of the places where he said this new cement product has already been used: The PGA headquarters in Frisco, the new Prosper High School, and some I-35 paving projects.
One last note: The Holcim plant was damaged in the February winter storm, which greatly impacted the supply of concrete mix in North Texas. In fact, months after the storm, some builders said they couldn’t even get enough to pour one complete new home foundation. Cleary said the Holcim plant is now operating again at full speed.","One last note: The Holcim plant was damaged in the February winter storm, which greatly impacted the supply of concrete mix in North Texas.

LOUIS — Millions of dollars in federal funding could help two Missouri cement plants, including one near Ste. Genevieve, nearly eliminate greenhouse gas emissions, the U.S. Department of Energy announced Wednesday.
The Ste. Genevieve Cement Plant, owned by the Swiss-based Holcim Group, and the Central Plains Cement Co.’s Sugar Creek Plant, outside of Kansas City, were named among a list of 12 industrial facilities nationwide that will split $45 million in funding aimed at advancing “carbon-capture” technology. The systems can capture at least 95% of carbon dioxide emissions from natural gas power generation and from the carbon-intensive production of commodities like cement and steel.
DOE awarded $4 million toward a carbon-capture project at the Holcim plant that will use an engineering design from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.
It allotted $5 million to a project at the Sugar Creek Plant that will be designed, built, and operated by Utah-based Sustainable Energy Solutions. It will have the ability to capture 30 tons of CO 2 daily.

“Funding of these projects puts the nation one step closer toward responsible demonstration and commercialization of this technology,” DOE said in a statement.
President Joe Biden aims to reduce carbon emissions to “net-zero” emissions by 2050, in hopes of curtailing a climate crisis that has grown increasingly urgent, scientists have recently said.
DOE officials said that the funding awarded Wednesday marks only an initial stage — it is intended to study how to use carbon capture at these sites. Actual construction costs of carbon-capture projects run into the hundreds of millions of dollars for individual industrial-scale facilities.
When it comes to cutting carbon, it’s cheapest and easiest to avoid emissions in the first place, whenever possible, said Jennifer Wilcox, the principal deputy assistant secretary for DOE’s Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management.
But she said activities targeted by the new DOE funding — like cement and steel production — are examples of “difficult-to-avoid” emissions that are likely to persist for the foreseeable future, even as renewable energy technologies mature and stem fossil fuel use. DOE hopes to help spark a difference in key industries, like those, which will require carbon capture for the U.S. to reach net-zero emissions.
Wilcox says, though, that there’s already demand for materials like cement to be made with reduced carbon emissions.
“These cement plants see that future,” said Wilcox, describing those receiving the DOE funding, and their incentive to pursue lower-emission production methods.
She said the financial awards reflect DOE’s priority to decarbonize the industrial sector.
“This is an area of focus that we’re really excited about having an impact in,” said Wilcox. She added that carbon capture is “not a blanket solution” for certain industries or activities, but represents an important part of the push to bring down emissions.
It is unclear what might become of the captured CO 2at the Missouri cement plants. For instance, some facilities featured in the announcement are in places where it is possible to pump carbon underground in a foam-like state, Wilcox said. In other cases, CO 2 could be liquefied and moved to storage facilities either by pipeline, or even by truck, in smaller quantities.
The DOE did not release project start dates.","For instance, some facilities featured in the announcement are in places where it is possible to pump carbon underground in a foam-like state, Wilcox said. The systems can capture at least 95% of carbon dioxide emissions from natural gas power generation and from the carbon-intensive production of commodities like cement and steel. When it comes to cutting carbon, it’s cheapest and easiest to avoid emissions in the first place, whenever possible, said Jennifer Wilcox, the principal deputy assistant secretary for DOE’s Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management."

Three of the top five global cement, aggregate and concrete producers have made the 2021 Climate Disclosure Project A List, reflecting transparency in environmental impact, greenhouse gas emissions management and water resource metrics. Cemex, HeidelbergCement and Holcim are among 200 A List/Climate category performers from a pool of 10,000-plus companies that London-based CDP observes.
“We commit to continue leading the industry in climate action, not only because it creates value, but more importantly because it is the right thing to do,” affirms Cemex CEO Fernando Gonzalez.
“This important recognition underlines our global climate leadership,” says HeidelbergCement Chairman Dr. Dominik Achten. “Implementing our carbon reduction roadmaps worldwide and heading the way globally with our ambitious carbon capture, utilization and storage plans are at the center of our climate strategy.”
“[The] A score is great recognition of progress in leading our sector’s net-zero transition in line with our 2050 goals,” adds Holcim CEO Jan Jenisch. “CDP rankings are a testimony to the tremendous work carried out by our 70,000 people around the world and a great encouragement for all of us to keep raising the bar.”
The producers scored A—slightly besting the A- of Dublin-based peer CRH Plc—for responses on questionnaires probing corporate Governance; Business Strategy; Targets and Performance; Emissions Methodology, Data and Breakdown; and, Energy measures. By scoring from D- to A, CDP takes participants “on a journey … measur[ing] the comprehensiveness of disclosure, awareness and management of environmental risks and best practices associated with environmental leadership, such as setting ambitious and meaningful targets.” Based on the range of businesses and operations across 2021 A List/Climate honorees, Cemex, CRH, Holcim and HeidelbergCement might well share the most common thread among CDP elite.
Along with the limited but unmistakable heavy building materials producer concentration, the A List/Climate category includes a handful of other brands close to or entrenched in construction, among them Komatsu Ltd., Kubota Corp. Lanxess AG, Paccar Inc. and (GCP Applied Technologies suitor) Saint-Gobain. Beyond Climate, the 2021 A List recognizes top performers in Forests, 24 companies, and Water Security, 118 companies.
“Taking the lead on environmental transparency and action is one of the most important steps businesses can make,” says CDP CEO Paul Simpson. “Leadership from the private sector is essential for securing global ambitions for a net-zero, nature positive and equitable world. Our A List celebrates those companies who are preparing themselves to excel in the economy of the future by taking action today.”

'These are the steps that we need to take now.' - St. Louis Post-Dispatch,"Missouri cement producers are looking to a range of new technologies — from freezing carbon as it exits smokestacks to chemically separating it — to combat the industry’s massive greenhouse gas pollution, and join a trend gathering momentum.
Missouri’s mix of abundant limestone and river access for shipping helps make it a national cement-production giant — trailing only Texas, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The world’s largest cement kiln of its kind is at a plant near Ste. Genevieve that’s set to explore the use of carbon capture technology.
The Ste. Genevieve plant run by Swiss-owned LafargeHolcim, the top cement producer in the U.S., is just one recent example reflecting the push to decarbonize. The site was one of two Missouri cement plants recently chosen by the U.S. Department of Energy to receive federal funding to assess carbon capture options on site, along with the Central Plains Cement Co.’s Sugar Creek Plant, outside of Kansas City. And in a separate move just a week later, Continental Cement Co., based in Chesterfield, announced its own intention to become carbon-neutral by 2050, joining a collection of industry peers.

The chain of moves is striking, given the material’s pervasiveness in modern society, and its outsized impact on the climate. Concrete — held together by cement — is the second-most used resource in the world by volume, behind water, academic experts say.
But making cement accounts for 5% to 8% of all carbon emissions, worldwide, the experts said. That’s roughly equal to the amount of global greenhouse gases from buildings, and about half of the emissions from transportation.
“Most people think about power plants and cars,” said Hafiz Salih, a research engineer at the University of Illinois who is managing a study on how to adopt carbon capture equipment at the Ste. Genevieve plant. “Usually people don’t think about cement.”
Tough to avoid
An enormous amount of energy is required to make cement. Producers start with materials such as limestone, shale, iron ore and clay, and put it into a kiln — generally a long, rotating pipe, with one end higher than the other. Materials gradually move from the high end to the low end, where flames heat the kiln to temperatures of 2,700 to 3,000 degrees, often derived from burning fuels like coal.
But the largest share of emissions comes from the raw materials themselves, which undergo a chemical change at those extreme temperatures — conditions that incinerate much of the carbon that makes up rocks like limestone, the chief ingredient in cement. For every ton of material fed into a cement kiln, only two-thirds of it remains as a solid that emerges from the other end.
That makes emissions from cement plants especially carbon-heavy: About 10% to 14% of the gas emitted from a coal-fired power plant is generally carbon dioxide, Salih said. But the gas represents 14% to 33% of the emissions from a cement plant.
That’s why companies like LafargeHolcim are now looking to carbon capture strategies, said Derick Dreyer, the company’s North American head of cement industrial performance, who also manages its development of carbon capture projects.
The Department of Energy is offering a helping hand, through efforts to target “difficult-to-avoid” emissions from certain industries.
“Our society is based on two main construction materials: concrete and steel,” said Claire White, an engineering professor at Princeton University and leader of the school’s Sustainable Cements Group. “We can’t stop constructing. ... We have to make sure it’s sustainable.”
A range of strategies exist to capture carbon emissions from industrial processes like cement production. Some techniques force a plant’s emissions, called flue gas, to undergo chemical reactions with certain solids or liquids, causing carbon dioxide to stay behind as the gas moves by. At the Ste. Genevieve plant, however, the plan is to evaluate a “cryogenic” system that will capture carbon by rapidly cooling the hot flue gas to opposite temperature extremes, and making it into a liquid.
“The CO2 will start to liquify before the other components,” said Salih, adding that the plan is to pump the liquified carbon thousands of feet underground, where it will be stored beneath an impermeable rock layer. The ultimate objective is to retrofit the plant with a system able to separate up to 95% of its carbon emissions.
Sense of urgency
The cryogenic approach to carbon capture is also being pursued at the Kansas City-area cement plant that received federal funding. The design of that system, spearheaded by a Utah-based firm, will have the potential to capture 30 tons of CO2 daily.
Meanwhile, the Chesterfield-based Continental Cement Co. did not identify a specific route for decarbonization, but said it signed onto an industry “roadmap” that examines carbon reduction “across all phases of the material’s life cycle, such as reducing CO2 from the manufacturing process, decreasing combustion emissions by changing fuel sources and shifting toward increased use of renewable electricity.” Continental did not respond to multiple requests for comment.
U.S. cement production is concentrated among a relatively small pool of facilities — just 96 plants spread across 34 states, plus two in Puerto Rico — and that means these new technologies, if successful, could be rapidly adopted and trigger sweeping change.
But experts warn that there’s not yet a lot pushing companies to change. The Department of Energy grants are one of the first significant jolts to advance this kind of investment. More widespread incentives from governments, though, “could completely change the situation,” White said.
But action must happen fast, if the world is to dodge the worst impacts of climate change.
“We don’t have time to wait around another 10 years before thinking to reduce these emissions,” said White.
LafargeHolcim so far is just studying options. It has not committed to installing the equipment in Ste. Genevieve.
But the company echoes a sense of urgency about establishing carbon-neutrality goals. It calls them an industry imperative.
“These are the steps that we need to take now,” said Dreyer. “We believe it’s the long-term solution in our industry.”","The site was one of two Missouri cement plants recently chosen by the U.S. Department of Energy to receive federal funding to assess carbon capture options on site, along with the Central Plains Cement Co.’s Sugar Creek Plant, outside of Kansas City.

Holcim (US) mill goes full bore on portland limestone cement
October 15, 2021October 29, 2021 Concrete News
A Texas concrete materials supply chain fixture, the Holcim (US) Inc. Midlothian plant is the first cement mill in the country to fully convert to production of portland limestone cement (PLC), where fine limestone at 5 percent to 15 percent volumes is ground with clinker. The finished binder exhibits performance comparable to ordinary portland cement, but has a lower embodied carbon factor due to the reduction of energy-intensive clinker.
The decision to convert Midlothian to OneCem, part of the Envirocore blended cement portfolio, represents what Chicago-based LafargeHolcim calls a “monumental step in the industry’s efforts to provide low-carbon materials and solutions.” OneCem has been rigorously tested and proven to serve as an effective alternative for ordinary portland cement, yielding durable, high-performance concrete. The Midlothian plant is capable of producing 2 million tons of cement per year. By shifting to OneCem from clinker-only finishing, the operation will be poised to reduce annual carbon dioxide emissions by up to 70 million pounds—a volume equivalent to the CO2 footprint of 5,800 homes’ energy consumption for one year. Against ordinary portland cement, OneCem provides the same level of performance in terms of concrete workability, set time, durability and strength development. Holcim (US) plans to rapidly expand production and distribution of the material beyond the Western and Southern regions where it has launched.
“This is an important, but not unique, step for us. We were the first to produce OneCem, a PLC product, in one of the fastest-growing metro areas in the country, and fuel our industry’s step towards a zero carbon future,” says LafargeHolcim Senior Vice President of Sales, U.S. Cement Patrick Cleary. “OneCem is one way we’re supporting customers who are using every tool at their disposal. In Texas and beyond, concrete producers are taking enormous strides and embracing solutions with environmental and performance benefits.”
“LafargeHolcim has gone on record with our net-zero [carbon emissions] commitment,” adds LafargeHolcim U.S. Cement CEO Toufic Tabbara. “Transitioning the operational focus at our Midlothian plant to OneCem reflects confidence in this product and growing customer demand for solutions that help achieve their sustainability goals.”
The Midlothian mill is located 30 miles south of the Dallas-Ft. Worth Metroplex, perennially one of the top markets for cement consumption.
LEHIGH HANSON REPACKAGES PLCEcoCemPLC portland limestone cement from Lehigh Hanson Inc. arrives at big box and construction supply accounts this month in updated bags. The packaging redesign dovetails an ongoing commitment to carbon footprint reduction and offering more sustainable options for Lehigh Hanson packaged or bulk cementitious products. A footprint icon plays prominently in the bag and emphasizes a key PLC metric: Carbon dioxide emissions factor about 10 percent below that of ordinary portland cement.

https://www.worldcement.com/europe-cis/01102021/holcim-croatias-koromano-plant-to-produce-low-carbon-cement/,"Fri, 01 Oct 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Holcim Croatia’s Koromacno plant to produce low carbon cement - World Cement,"Holcim's cement factory in Koromacno has received the financial support of HRK 3.3 million for the production of low-carbon types of cement. Innovation Norway is the Norwegian Financial Mechanism 2014 – 2021, and Holcim's project is co-financed under the Business Development and Innovation Croatia Programme. The name of the project with which Holcim applied for the tender is ‘Development of new types of cements with a lower carbon footprint.’
Under the European Union's legislative framework, which encourages the decarbonisation of Europe by 2050, investment in a number of technologies to reduce CO2 emissions will need to be encouraged in the next few years. In addition, the Green Plan of the European Union seeks better management according to the hierarchy of waste management, which encourages the use of waste or by-products of an industrial process in the creation and production of a new product. This is made possible by the European standard for cement production, which is also applied in Croatia.
""Currently, our factory in Koromacno has a technological limitation in the dosing of mineral additives, and that is why we have envisaged the improvement of that technology with this project. The new conditions, after we implement this project, will allow us to make greater use of mineral supplements. Otherwise, mineral admixtures in cement have a threefold benefit: on the one hand, different characteristics are created in the cement to meet the requirements of different types of construction. On the other hand, the useful use of already existing resources increases and the use of natural resources decreases. As a result, the third benefit is that in this way the share of clinker in the cement, ie the carbon footprint, is reduced,"" said Nikola Kovacevic, Director of Holcim's cement factory.
The goal of the project is to increase competitiveness while reducing CO emissions, lower electricity consumption and lower dust emissions. During the Holcim project, a closed storage of mineral additives and a new transport system for their dosing should be built, and the production of two new types of low-carbon cement should begin.
The entire project is worth around HRK 9.6 million, of which 35% or around HRK 3.3 million will be supported by the Norwegian Financial Mechanism 2014 – 2021, within the Business Development and Innovation Croatia Programme, provided that Holcim proves that the entire project led according to the rules of that financial mechanism. The project starts on 01 October this year, and will end on 31 July 2023.

CEMEX and Holcim have joined the First Movers Coalition (FMC) as founding members to drive more green demand and low-carbon technologies in this decade, to help advance the world’s climate goals.
Launched at COP26 by Secretary John Kerry, US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, and the World Economic Forum (WEF), the new initiative unites more than two dozen of the world’s leading companies to accelerate innovation and the development of early stage decarbonization technologies by leveraging their combined purchasing power.
It is the only buyers’ club working to scale new and emerging technologies across the heavy industry and heavy-duty transport sectors.
According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), roughly half of the emission reductions needed to reach the critical 2050 climate target of keeping the global temperature increase below 1.5°C, compared with pre-industrial levels, will rely on new and emerging technologies.
The new coalition will work across eight key sectors, seven of which – steel, cement, aluminium, chemicals, shipping, aviation, and trucking – account for more than a third of global carbon emissions, but do not currently have cost-competitive energy alternatives to fossil fuels.
John Kerry said: ‘The First Movers Coalition is a platform for the world’s leading global companies to make purchasing commitments to create early markets for critical technologies needed to achieve net-zero by 2050.
‘In this critical decade, we not only need to deploy as rapidly as possible existing clean energy technologies, such as wind turbines, solar panels, and battery storage, but also drive innovation for our long-term decarbonization goals.’
CEMEX chief executive officer Fernando A. González commented: ‘We are proud to join forces with the World Economic Forum and other global companies to accelerate the development of critical new decarbonizing technologies.
‘Our shared goals and the investments announced today would not be possible without the steadfast leadership shown throughout this process by Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry and the World Economic Forum.’
Holcim chief executive officer Jan Jenisch said: ‘The net-zero transition requires unprecedented collaboration across value chains. The First Movers Coalition can achieve this. Together we can grow the demand for net-zero solutions to drive more investment in next-generation green technologies.
‘As one of the founding members, Holcim are committed to taking action on both the demand and supply side. We will buy more net-zero vehicles and continue to grow our range of green building solutions to scale up net-zero construction.’
Børge Brende, president of the World Economic Forum, commented: ‘Technology has given us the tools to reduce our emissions and build a stronger and more inclusive economy of the future. For innovators and investors to play their part in tackling the climate crisis, they need clear market demand.
‘The First Movers Coalition will leverage the collective purchasing power of leading companies and drive the need for these technologies. I call on business leaders to work with us and be the role models keeping our climate goals alive.’

The floor solution was designed by Block Research Group (BRG) of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zurich) using the principles of strength through geometry. The sustainability profile of the floor solution is driven by its smart design, using 50% less materials, its green concrete with Holcim’s ECOPact Plus offering a 33% lower carbon footprint and its circularity profile using Holcim’s green cement with 20% recycled construction and demolition waste inside. With traditional floor slabs in reinforced concrete accounting for 40% of the concrete mass of medium-rise buildings, the combination of smart design with green and circular building materials makes sustainable construction possible at scale. This breakthrough in sustainable floor construction is implemented for the first time in the HiLo (High Performance, Low Emissions) innovation unit at NEST (Next Evolution in Sustainable Building Technologies) in Dübendorf, Switzerland.
Jan Jenisch, Holcim CEO: “This innovative floor system represents a real breakthrough in sustainable construction. It is a great example of how our key levers to net-zero building add up to make a real difference, from green concrete, to smart design, all the way to circularity. What’s exciting is that all this innovation is to put to work in a floor system that can be deployed at scale. With today’s rise in population and urbanisation, we expect to be building ten billion square metres of floors each year to house two billion additional people in cities by 2050. I am committed to accelerating the deployment of such green building solutions to make our cities work for people and the planet.”
Philippe Block, Co-director of the Block Research Group at ETH Zurich: “When it comes to finding sustainable construction solutions, floor slabs are a key challenge. Arched and vaulted geometries offer truly disruptive savings by enabling the use of low-carbon materials in much lower volume than before.”
The floor system’s design eliminates the need for embedded steel reinforcement, making it easy to recycle. Building functionalities such as efficient hydronic heating and cooling systems can be seamlessly integrated. Holcim and BRG are currently developing the floor system into a precast solution, targeted to be available for industrialised construction in 2023.
This solution represents how Holcim’s commitment to net-zero building is in action. Making low carbon construction possible at scale, Holcim launched the world’s first global ranges of green concrete ECOpact and green cement ECOPlanet, now available worldwide. To build more with less, Holcim enables smart design with technologies like 3D printing that can reduce up to 70% of material use. To build new from the old, it is driving the circular economy as a world leader in recycling, such as with the launch of the world's first green cement with 20% recycled construction and demolition waste inside. For breakthrough impact beyond 2030, Holcim is piloting next generation technologies like carbon capture utilisation and storage, recycling its CO2 in many ways - from crop growth in greenhouses all the way to using it as a source of alternative fuel for aviation. To scale up its impact, Holcim is actively partnering with like-minded organisations. It serves as a founding member of the First Movers Coalition, launched by Secretary John Kerry, the United States Special Envoy for Climate, to accelerate our world’s transition to net zero. Holcim is also a founding member of the MIT Climate and Sustainability Consortium to put innovation to work in a cross-sectoral way for more impact.

https://coloradosun.com/2021/11/26/carbon-sequestration-colorado-battling-greenhouse-gases/,"Fri, 26 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",Colorado tees up carbon sequestration in next round of greenhouse fight - The Colorado Sun,"- Credibility:
Colorado has snuffed the carbon-spewing smokestacks of some of its most noxious coal-fired plants.
It’s tasked the oil and gas companies with plugging methane leaks in pipelines and capping carbon-weeping abandoned wells.
And the state wants belching, gas-fueled V8s to turn themselves in for EVs with no tailpipe.
Now, in another potentially crucial push to quarantine CO2 and combat greenhouse gas emissions, state leaders want a system to cram some of the remaining torrents of carbon emissions underground and lock them up in salt formations at least 3,000 feet deep.
A task force on Colorado’s potential for carbon sequestration, convened by the Colorado School of Mines and the Colorado Energy Office, is finishing up a report calling on the legislature and regulators to boost the idea. They want funding of carbon-capture research, for example, and state agencies to smooth the way for CO2 pipelines.
Carbon sequestration could prove big in the climate change battle on two fronts. First, efforts to slash Colorado carbon emissions by 50% by 2030 could fall short if EVs do not replace gas engines fast enough, or if cleanly electrifying building and home systems goes slower than hoped. Some industries’ use of fossil fuels will prove stubborn, such as regional cement kilns requiring extremely high heat. Perfecting and deploying carbon capture technology could get Colorado to its emissions goals as fossil fuel use winds down.
Second, with the world apparently skidding past the 1.5-degree Celsius warming cap global scientists have targeted as the upper limit for humans readily adapting to climate change, carbon capture could in theory pull past carbon emissions out of the atmosphere and try to reverse the temperature climb. Experiments to do just that are underway in Iceland and other locations. Colorado’s geology, in both the northeastern oil fields and southwestern salt formations, could be one of the places used to pull the Earth back from the temperature brink through sequestration.
“How are we going to get to zero carbon emissions and recognize the fact that as a society, we’re still going to need things like cement and concrete, and some of these things are hard to decarbonize?” said Pat O’Connell, an advisor to the Colorado task force and a New Mexico engineer and energy analyst with Western Resource Advocates.
“We’re going to need technologies like carbon capture, storage and use to get there,” O’Connell said.
Colorado’s 2005 benchmark for CO2 emissions was about 140 million tons a year. From there, state law demands the total to be cut by 26% in 2025, and 50% in 2030.
To give an idea of the scale of the largest emitters, the Rio Grande cement plant in Pueblo emitted 802,000 tons in 2020, according to the EPA. Many gas- and coal-fired power plants were over 1 million tons each, and the emissions champ was Xcel’s Comanche complex in Pueblo, at 4.5 million tons.
Task force members also want to ensure that possible future pipelines, drilling and underground salt dome storage for carbon meet the environmental justice provisions codified in successive rounds of greenhouse gas laws. In other words, don’t exacerbate past pollution injustice against low-income and minority communities by desecrating tribal lands with pipelines, or damaging the drinking water of rural neighborhoods.
“When we proceed, we need to make sure we do a better job locating and operating the new stuff, so that we don’t perpetuate the environmental justice problems that we’ve created,” O’Connell said.
The Carbon Capture, Utilization and Sequestration task force is not recommending specific projects for Colorado, but members have discussed where the state offers potential:
- Hard-to-decarbonize industries: While electric utilities are changing over to cleaner fuels relatively quickly, some of Colorado’s biggest greenhouse gas polluters have no easy switch to make. The state’s three major cement-baking kilns are prime targets for future carbon capture. Firing lime and other materials to make “clinker” for cement requires huge amounts of fossil fuel burning. Lafarge Holcim’s plant in Florence has been studying underground storage possibilities, though details haven’t emerged.
- Alternative uses of carbon: Oil and gas producers have injected CO2 underground to revive production in depleting fields, though some researchers are leery of using captured CO2 in an industry responsible for creating a large portion of greenhouse gases to date. Concrete producers are studying whether carbon produced in the cement portion of the material could be recaptured in the concrete itself, locking it up for decades if not centuries.
- Pipelines to salt deposit injection sites: Salt domes built up when Colorado and other Western states were under ancient oceans create impermeable vaults for carbon. But you have to get the gas from the cement plants or other emitters to distant injection fields. Legislation could hand permitting and eminent domain rights to the Public Utilities Commission or another agency, but task force members do not fully agree on how much power to suggest be written into law.
After meeting for months, task force members are optimistic Colorado is ready to fund research and demonstration projects and move forward on enabling rules, said Laura Singer, carbon capture program manager for the Colorado School of Mines.
“It just needs a little more time to kind of develop to the scale,” Singer said. “And actually, the only way that kind of development is going to happen is just by starting to build projects and learning by doing.”
Scaling up projects will also require educating the public, Singer said. People will wonder about injecting carbon into saline formations that include some water, but they need to know the Colorado salt formations are much deeper than drinking water sources. The saline aquifers are “brackish, non-potable water,” she said. Naturally occurring carbon dioxide formations are already underground in many locations.
U.S. Geological Survey studies show federal researchers have looked at potential storage qualities at basins in the far southwest and northwestern corners of Colorado, and in the northeast Denver Basin in many of the same areas as oil and gas exploration.
States pursuing carbon capture now have significant federal money to help, Singer and O’Connell noted. The federal infrastructure stimulus package just signed by President Biden includes $12 billion to distribute to states for carbon capture, pipeline development, technology competitions and storage projects
State officials, academic researchers and private industry need to position themselves to jump on those opportunities, Singer said. “There are big federal expenditures coming down the pike in this area for research and demonstration.”
We believe vital information needs to be seen by the people impacted, whether it’s a public health crisis, investigative reporting or keeping lawmakers accountable. This reporting depends on support from readers like you.","People will wonder about injecting carbon into saline formations that include some water, but they need to know the Colorado salt formations are much deeper than drinking water sources.

MEXICO CITY, Nov 3 (Reuters) - Industries from cement to mining are creating plans to cap and cut their planet-warming emissions, and many depend on a technology still in development: carbon capture.
There are two main types of carbon capture and storage: Point-source carbon capture and storage (CCS) sequesters CO2 produced at the source, like a smokestack, while direct air capture (DAC) removes carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. Captured CO2 usually is permanently stored underground, although carbon capture utilization and storage (CCUS) reuses the CO2.
The technology, however, is not yet widely available and is highly expensive.

The capacity of CCS projects grew 48% from 75 million tonnes per annum (mpta) at the end of 2020 to 111 mtpa by September, according to the Australia-based Global CCS Institute. Several groups see a need for billions of tonnes of storage by midcentury; Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) expects a $2 trillion market by 2040.
Here's how four large industries, all major carbon emitters, are using CCS technology.
CEMENT AND CONCRETE
Cement and concrete production accounts for about 8% of global CO2 emissions. Massive kilns that heat raw materials in order to make clinker, a key ingredient of cement, account for the majority of emissions.
The Global Cement and Concrete Association recently announced a road map to net-zero cement by 2050 and pledged 10 industrial-scale carbon capture plants by 2030.
Carbon capture technology is the ""elephant in the room,"" Fernando Gonzalez, chief executive of Mexico's Cemex, said in a company presentation this month, referring to the challenges around developing the technology.
Cemex (CEMEXCPO.MX) North America's largest cement producer, Switzerland-based Holcim AG (HOLN.S), formerly LafargeHolcim, and Germany's HeidelbergCement (HEIG.DE) all are working on projects.
IRON AND STEEL
The process of making iron and steel is energy and carbon intensive due to the use of fossil fuels like coal to power blast furnaces, and output has grown in recent years.
To hit emissions targets, 75% of CO2 produced globally by the sector needs to be captured, according to the World Steel Association. That equates to 14 steel plants with CCS technology built every year from 2030 to 2070. Currently, the world has only one large-scale iron and steel facility with CCS.
ArcelorMittal (MT.LU), one of the world's largest steelmakers, signed a Memorandum of Understanding this year with Air Liquide, a France-based industrial gases company, to develop carbon capture technologies with the aim of producing low-carbon steel at its Dunkirk site.
OIL AND GAS
Until recently, capturing carbon produced by fossil fuels and injecting it underground has largely been a means to squeeze more oil from aging wells. There are several proposals to build CCS hubs, but few have gone beyond the development stage.
Now, numerous large energy companies are incorporating CCS into their plans for reducing emissions, but the lack of carbon trading markets or tax incentives to make the investment worthwhile has held back U.S. development.
Occidental Petroleum (OXY.N) is currently developing with private equity firm Rusheen Capital Management a Direct Air Capture facility in Texas that would pull about 1 million metric tons of CO2 annually from the air – using fans and chemical reactions. Occidental created a business, 1PointFive, to build a demonstration unit and sell direct carbon capture facilities to others.
Chevron (CVX.N) has said it plans on using carbon capture and offsets to cut operational emissions to net zero by 2050, with plans to store roughly 25 million tonnes of CO2 annually. It plans on spending roughly $8 billion by 2028 in low-carbon investments that includes carbon capture and offsets.
MINING
Parts of the mining industry see carbon capture and storage as a way to reduce emissions at coal-fired power plants, the main source of electricity in mining hub Australia. Some mining companies are also studying ways to replace natural gas in operations with hydrogen, which does not produce carbon emissions when burned.
The Minerals Council of Australia called hydrogen production and CCS “critically important technologies” for a country that gets about 65% of its electricity from coal. Gassified coal also can be used to produce hydrogen.
Rio Tinto Ltd , one of the world's largest mining companies, in October said it would invest $4 million into privately held Carbon Capture Inc, which is developing technology to suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere and chemically bind it - and thus permanently store it - to rocks. If the technology works at a large scale, it could allow Rio to market copper and other electric vehicles minerals it produces as carbon neutral.

8:31 a.m.: COP26 pledges would limit global warming to 1.8 degrees Celsius, IEA says
If every pledge made at COP26 is honored, it would put the world on track to limit global warming to 1.8 degrees Celsius, the IEA has said.
""If all the pledges on carbon neutrality and methane were to be fully implemented, we would have a temperature increase trajectory which is 1.8 degrees Celsius,"" Fatih Birol, executive director of the IEA told an audience at the summit on Thursday.
The Paris Agreement's objective is to prevent global temperatures from rising by any more than 2 degrees Celsius, although the treaty's more ambitious target is to prevent global temperature rises exceeding 1.5 degrees Celsius.
Birol said the 1.8 degrees Celsius trajectory, predicted by the IEA's models, was ""extremely encouraging"" and ""excellent"" news, but he conceded on Twitter that more work needed to be done.

The world wants to ""transition"" away from fossil fuels toward green energy, but the difficult reality is this: Dirty fuels are not going away — or even declining — anytime soon.
The total amount of renewable energy that's available is growing. That's good news for a world threatened by potentially devastating climate change.
But the increase in renewable energy is still lower than the increase in global energy demand overall. A ""transition"" from fossil fuels may come someday, but for now, renewable energy isn't even keeping pace with rising energy demand — so fossil fuel demand is still growing.

MANILA, Philippines — Holcim Philippines Inc. is spending P210 million on projects meant to raise the efficiency of its cement factories by reducing both fuel consumption and carbon footprint.
The new investment would benefit Holcim’s plants in Bacnotan, La Union and Lugait, Misamis Oriental, the listed cement manufacturer told the stock exchange on Thursday. Horia Adrian, company president and chief executive, said the projects would contribute to Holcim’s goal of “making operations more sustainable”.
For its multimillion peso plan, Holcim hired Sinoma CBMIPH Construction Corp. — the local unit of China-based Sinoma CBMI — to install a drying facility in its La Union plant that would reuse hot gases from operations to dry materials instead of a separate equipment, thereby reducing fuel consumption.
Sinoma CBMIPH would also install another drying facility in Holcim’s Misamis Oriental factory reduce moisture of raw materials to improve grinding operations. In turn, the plant can now increase the use of less energy-intensive materials like mineral additives when manufacturing cement products.
Cement production is a carbon-intensive process that consumes considerable amount of resources and energy. It is during the production of clinker, the main component of cement, when most carbon emissions occur.
By replacing the clinker in final cement products with alternative mineral components, the company can cut the carbon intensity of operations.
“More efficient operations will help us deliver better financial results and improve our environmental footprint,” Adrian said.
The project in Holcim’s La Union factory is scheduled to be completed in the first quarter of 2022 while that in Misamis Oriental is set to be finished in October this year.
In January, Holcim Philippines started projects worth P121.5 million to raise the efficiency of converting qualified waste materials to alternative fuels of its cement plant in Norzagaray, Bulacan.
Shares in Holcim rallied 4.18% on Thursday to close at P7.48 apiece, bucking a downtrend in the main index.

Through the Industrial Deep Decarbonisation Initiative (IDDI), countries, industry, and intergovernmental- and non-government partners are setting the standards for green building products and ways to track their embodied carbon.
We need more governments to take the lead by making 2030 commitments for greener steel and concrete now, so that these products become the norm by mid-century.
By LI Yong, Director General of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO)
Stalled steel and cement plants in Europe and India, monster blackouts slowing factories in China, Germany’s deadly floods, Madagascar’s drought – If 2020 was the year of an unexpected pandemic, 2021 will be the year of two unprecedented but expected crises. The energy and climate crises, two sides of the same coin. It’s time to stop the dangerous growth of green-house gas emissions, by decoupling industrial development from climate-polluting energy use. And, we have the levers to do it. We need governments to step up now, starting with steel and concrete.
Steel and concrete are the fabric of our modern societies. They make our homes, cars, roads, hospitals, schools and appliances. Their use is also booming as urbanization and industrialization gain pace across the global south. The world is expected to build the equivalent of another New York City every month for the next 40 years. Globally, we are already adding the entire built area of Japan, annually. Steel and concrete are responsible for 14–16 per cent of global energy-related CO2 emissions. Changing the way our societies’ build will require revolutionizing these industries’ core processes. This massive task must be tackled if our global community is to meet the climate-safe targets agreed in 2015 – but the pathway is clear.
The good news, and an action that can be a game-changer, is that we can affordably decarbonise steel and concrete production by mid-century, if we start now. Industry leaders have already begun. They know that the risk of climate-related assets becoming stranded is too high and costly. To safeguard their future prosperity, cement and steel makers, such as Holcim, thyssenkrupp and HeidelbergCement, have made commitments to net-zero production targets and are researching promising technologies, such as replacing fossil fuels with green hydrogen. The finance sector is also making important moves. Earlier this year, six global banks agreed to develop a climate-aligned finance agreement to support decarbonization of the steel sector.
Governments now need to take urgent action to make greener steel and concrete commercially viable. Accelerating the transformation of these industries is the way to build back better. A group of countries, together with the UN Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), are taking the lead through the Industrial Deep Decarbonisation Initiative (IDDI). The United Kingdom, India, Germany, Canada, the United Arab Emirates as well as industry and non-government partners are setting the standards for green building products and establishing ways to track their embodied carbon. This is an essential and significant first step.
IDDI partners also want to use green public procurement to create markets for low-carbon steel and concrete. Governments buy 40 per cent of the cement and 25 per cent of the steel sold in their domestic markets. By pledging to purchase significant amounts of low-carbon steel and concrete, governments are sending strong signals to industries that “if you make it, we’ll buy it”, hence triggering the needed investments for production scale- up.
More governments need to take the lead by making 2030 commitments for greener steel and concrete now, so that these products become the norm by mid-century. At the recent G20 Summit, leaders reinforced their commitments to limit global warming and take further action to limit GHG emissions. The pivotal UN Climate Change conference COP26, ongoing in Glasgow, presents a unique chance for governments to show leadership and accelerate the transformation towards green steel and concrete, securing a safe and prosperous future for everyone.","By LI Yong, Director General of the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO)

PARIS, June 30 (Reuters) - Dozens of Extinction Rebellion protesters on Wednesday invaded a cement-making plant in Paris operated by construction giant LafargeHolcim to denounce what they called the firm's environmentally damaging pursuit of profit.
Lafarge workers in hard hats and fluorescent jackets sat on the ground as the protesters daubed graffiti across the site and hung banners, one of which read: ""Build to death"".
The protest forced Swiss-headquartered LafargeHolcim to halt operations at the Port de Javel site near the Eiffel Tower and divert trucks to another site.

""We need to act now! We know what needs doing and it's to stop this constant pursuit of growth and reduce carbon emissions. And for that to happen we need to stop using cement,"" said one protester who identified himself as Adrien.
Loic Leuliette, a spokesperson for LafargeHolcim France, said the company was investing in 'greener' cement.
A day earlier, the protesters, who include activists from the NGO Soulevements de la Terre, targetted another LafargeHolcim site on the northern fringe of Paris.
Leuliette said the unit at the site of Wednesday's protest was due to be replaced with a more modern plant in 2022.
""If there is one thing we share with the protesters, it's concern for the environment. But our responsibility is to supply cement to the construction sector,"" Leuliette said. ""The cement from here builds hospitals and schools.""

Jan Jenisch, CEO Holcim: “The building sector has an essential role to play to accelerate our world’s transition to net zero. I am proud to be joining the Science Based Targets initiative today to announce Holcim’s net zero pathway to 2050. By setting the first Net-Zero Standard for our industry, we are walking the talk on our commitment to take science-driven action to win the Race to Net Zero.”
Alberto Carrillo Pineda, Co-Founder and Managing Director of the SBTi: “Companies are currently self-defining net-zero targets without credible and independent assessment of their ambition and integrity. For the first time, the SBTi Net-Zero Standard offers companies robust certification to demonstrate to consumers, investors and regulators that their net-zero targets are reducing emissions at the pace and scale required to keep global warming to 1.5°C. We’re now inviting all companies with net-zero targets and ambitions to show stakeholders that their decarbonisation pathway is aligned with science. And the rest of the business sector – we call on you to join the Race to Zero.”
Holcim is taking a rigorous science-driven approach to build a net-zero future, working with the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). With its new 2050 pathway, the company is the first in its sector with net-zero targets for 2030 and 2050 validated by SBTi, cutting across its entire value chain (Scope 1, 2 and 3). See full details here.
Holcim is actively working on all levers to accelerate its sector’s transition to net zero. It is making green building possible at scale with the world’s first global ranges of green concrete ECOPact and green cement ECOPlanet. It is driving the circular economy to build new from the old, as a world leader in recycling on its way to 100 million tons of recycled materials by 2030.

Some of the world's largest cement and concrete businesses have committed to reduce the emissions intensity of their products by up to 25% this decade, as the industry works towards a shared net-zero vision for 2050.
The new 2030 commitments are part of a roadmap published today (12 October) by the Global Cement and Concrete Association (GCCA), a trade body representing 40+ companies that account for 80% of global production outside of China. Members include Cemex, Holcim and HeidelbergCement.
Building on the formation of the Association’s Concrete Action for Climate initiative earlier this year – a scheme aimed at enabling the transition to carbon-neutral products by 2050 – the roadmap outlines which solutions will be used to mitigate emissions, and the timelines to which they will be implemented.
The roadmap states that more than one-third (36%) of emissions generated by the sector in 2050 will be addressed using carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) technologies.
Association members have collectively committed to bringing 10 industrial-scale CCUS arrays online this decade. The report states that “it is critical that in this decade we bring forward the required breakthrough technologies to be ready for commercial-scale deployment by the end of it”.
A further 22% of emissions can be mitigated through efficiency improvements in design and construction, the roadmap states, with efficiency improvements in production delivering savings of a further 11%. Another 11% of emissions can be addressed by innovating clinker production, improving efficiency and transitioning to low-carbon fuels like waste-derived options and low-carbon hydrogen.
The remaining 20% of emissions could be mitigated through a combination of renewable electricity procurement and electrification, substituting Portland clinker cement and through insetting – using concrete as a carbon sink.
Looking at the likely timelines for implementing these solutions, the report states that the industry will be able to reduce the emissions intensity of concrete by 25% and cement by 20% by 2030. Both targets have a 2020 baseline and intensity will be measured in terms of emissions generated per tonne of product manufactured. Emissions will be accounted for across the life cycle.
The GCCA claims the 2030 and 2050 targets are aligned with the Paris Agreement’s 1.5C trajectory. This is despite the fact that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) landmark report in 2018 stated that global emissions must be halved by 2030 to give the best chance of limiting the temperature increase in this manner. However, cement and concrete are harder-to-abate than many other sectors, which could deliver reductions above 50% this decade.
“I am proud of the commitment made by our members today to take decisive action and accelerate industry decarbonization between now and 2030, an important milestone towards the ultimate goal of net-zero concrete,” said the Association’s chief executive Thomas Guillot.
“I envision a world in the not too distant future where the foundation of a sustainable, zero-carbon global economy will literally be built with green concrete.
“We now need governments around the world to work with us and use their huge procurement power to advocate for low carbon concrete in their infrastructure and housing needs. … Global cooperation on decarbonizing concrete is a necessity, as countries developing their infrastructure and housing will be the biggest users of concrete in the coming decades.”
To Guillot’s latter point, public infrastructure accounts for almost 60% of all global cement and concrete demand.
the cement and concrete industry accounts for 7% of global annual greenhouse gas emissions at present, but will need to grow in the coming years and decades to match the pace of urbanisation and growing demand for infrastructure that will enable the low-carbon transition. Indeed, the UN estimates that 75% of public infrastructure that will exist globally in 2050 does not yet exist. As such, emissions will need to be decoupled from growth.
Net-zero trends
2019 and 2020 saw an influx of corporate net-zero commitments for the long-term, as businesses took the first steps to align with updated climate targets from nations.
But there was a growing sentiment that such commitments would, ultimately, no be sufficient without plans to lay strong foundations in the short-term and medium-term, meaning they could simply be used as a form of greenwashing or “sustainability-as-usual”. Research by South Pole late last year found that just 10% of businesses with net-zero targets for 2050 or sooner have science-based interim goals.
As such, the past few months have seen many businesses setting interim targets – many of them science-based. At the start of July, the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) had approved ambitions for 796 companies. As of today, the figure stands at 973.
Since October began, edie has covered updated interim targets from big names including Virgin Atlantic, Grosvenor Britain and Ireland, Mars, McDonald’s, Marks & Spencer and Orchard Street.

https://www.politico.eu/sponsored-content/building-back-better-in-europe/,"Mon, 12 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Building back better in Europe - POLITICO Europe,"Does 3D-printing a concrete bridge that holds solely through compression with no reinforcements inside, while using a minimal amount of material in a circular way sound futuristic to you? Yet, the Striatus bridge that is on display during the Venice Biennale is a live illustration of this, demonstrating how we can build a net-zero future with no compromise on aesthetics and functionality. It represents a new language for concrete that is technology-driven, environmentally advanced and circular by design.
This bridge is the first of its kind, designed using arch and vault-like shapes, based on masonry techniques of the past, following the principles of strength through geometry. It’s a project by Block Research Group (ETH) and Zaha Hadid Architects (ZHA), in collaboration with incremental3D. Holcim was part of the project from concept to construction, making it possible with our custom-made proprietary 3D-printing ink.
The bridge uses advanced technologies from computational design and robotic manufacturing, to 3D concrete printing to build more with less. Circular by design, it is built using the exact amount of material needed and nothing more, and its concrete blocks can be infinitely reused or recycled into new building materials. It represents a great example of how smart design plays a key role in optimizing a building’s performance and environmental footprint.
The Striatus bridge is just one example of the solutions we are deploying to accelerate our world’s transition to a net-zero future. This kind of innovation, accelerating low-carbon building, is critical to building back better in Europe, to meet the region’s ambitious net-zero vision.
The renovation challenge in the EU
With 85 percent of its building stock built before 2001, one of Europe’s main challenges is to improve its existing building stock to make it more resilient and sustainable. The EU has set its ambition to double the renovation rate by 2030, making over 30 million homes, schools or hospitals more energy efficient and low carbon, while creating jobs and supporting the transition to renewable energy. With this renovation wave, we have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to accelerate the transition to low-carbon, circular and energy-efficient buildings.
At Holcim we are ready for this great rebuilding and renovation effort at the forefront of green building solutions. To accelerate this shift, we are:
- Deploying low carbon building materials globally — for instance our ECOPact green concrete is the world’s broadest range of low-carbon concrete, ranging from 30 percent lower footprint to carbon neutral. It is globally available today across over 20 markets, with its widest adoption rate in Europe, enabling carbon neutral construction at scale.
- Enhancing energy efficiency in buildings — with up to 60 percent of a building’s energy lost though its roof, our Firestone building products, ranging from cool to green roofing systems, play a critical role in enhancing a building’s energy efficiency. They add to our range of solutions from our Airium insulating foam, to concrete’s natural thermal insulating properties.
- Developing new technologies to build more with less — from 3D printing to ORIS, our industry’s first digital materials platform for building roads, we are putting technology to work to build more with less to ensure we can improve living standards around the world.
- Driving the circular economy — we are a world leader in recycling with up to 50 million tons of materials recycled across our business this year, on our way to 100 million tons by 2030. For instance, we launched the world’s very first green cement with 20 percent recycled construction and demolition waste inside, representing 20 percent less resources drawn from nature.
Circular construction is a catalyst to building a net-zero future
Low carbon and circular construction is possible today. What’s holding us back is making it mainstream. The more we work with key players across our value chain to make it the norm rather than the exception, the faster we can transition to a net-zero built environment.
Let me share the example of Switzerland. It is the first and only country in the world where building regulations allow us to recycle 20 percent of construction and demolition waste into cement. We are doing this today with our green cement ECOplanet enabling low-carbon construction at equal to superior performance. What’s more, we are working on pilots with ETH Zurich using 50 percent of recycled construction and demolition waste, with no compromise on performance.
Based on our experience in Switzerland, we know it’s possible to build in more circular ways. Imagine if the whole world enabled it.
With this renovation wave, we have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to accelerate the transition to low-carbon, circular and energy-efficient buildings.
We also know that building a net-zero future starts within our own operations. We are on a journey to become a net-zero company, with the most ambitious 2030 climate targets in our industry, validated by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). We are actively investing across our sites to operate with alternative energy by recycling waste at the end of its life cycle into alternative fuels. Two of our plants in Europe already operate with 100 percent alternative fuels.
We are also preparing the next steps of our net-zero journey by piloting advanced technologies such as Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage (CCUS). The EU regulation will be essential to recognize both technologies — CCU and CCS — in carbon accounting.
Partnering to scale up impact
I am encouraged to see public authorities, from the EU and individual countries all the way to city municipalities, taking action by setting new regulatory standards to incentivize net-zero buildings. I would also like to see further deployment of green procurement strategies to embed climate action in public spending.
The EU Green Deal offers a unique opportunity to create a competitive business environment to accelerate the transition to a net-zero built environment by :
- Encouraging innovation: with incentives to accelerate the development of net-zero solutions
- Adopting advanced norms and standards: This is crucial as our sector relies significantly on technical standards. We need to make sure that standards evolve to incentivize low-carbon and circular solutions.
- Defining a carbon lifecycle performance model for buildings: Making a building carbon neutral requires measuring its performance over its entire lifecycle. That’s why it’s key to mobilize all players across our value chain to define this model together.
- Ensuring a level-playing field with importers: Making decarbonization investments a competitive driver for business growth in Europe.
Our world has a unique opportunity to rebuild for a net-zero future. At Holcim, we are ready to play our part with our low-carbon, circular and energy-efficiency solutions. Let’s make it happen together.","Partnering to scale up impact

https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/lafargeholcim-expands-affordable-3d-printed-housing-project-to-zimbabwe-189475/,"Tue, 04 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",LafargeHolcim expands affordable 3D printed housing project to Zimbabwe - 3D Printing Industry,"Lafarge Cement Zimbabwe, a subsidiary of building materials specialist LafargeHolcim, is set to build affordable, low-carbon homes in Zimbabwe using the company’s concrete 3D printing technology.
The project aims to address Zimbabwe’s chronic shortage of housing and school infrastructure, with construction expected to begin later this year.
“To showcase the capabilities of 3D printing, Lafarge Cement Zimbabwe will construct 10 units in Knockmalloch under the affordable housing project currently underway,” the company told The Herald.
“This project will afford relevant stakeholders to witness and experience the capabilities of this innovative technology and it is anticipated that this will attract more projects towards the use of the technology to provide decent affordable housing.”
Meeting Africa’s affordable housing demand
The concrete 3D printing technology Lafarge Cement Zimbabwe will use during the project was developed by 14Trees, a subsidiary of LafargeHolcim and joint venture with CDC Group, the UK’s publicly owned impact investor.
Using a proprietary ink from LafargeHolcim, the 3D printing technology is expected to significantly reduce the time and costs of building homes and schools. The project initially began in Malawi, where the first prototype house was built. The walls of the house were printed in just 12 hours, while the first prototype school was printed in 18 hours.
As well as speeding up the construction of new buildings, 14Trees’ 3D printing technology reportedly reduces the carbon footprint for building new homes by up to 70 percent through optimizing the use of materials.
“I am very excited about the work of our joint venture 14Trees, innovating in 3D printing technology to accelerate affordable and sustainable building, from homes to schools,” said Miljan Gutovic, Region Head Middle East Africa and LafargeHolcim Executive Committee member, in December when the project was first announced. “This is a great example of our commitment to build for people and the planet.”
The technology was initially deployed in Malawi during the first phase of the project before being rolled out to Kenya and Zimbabwe. LafargeHolcim recently opened a new $2.8 million dry mortar plant in Zimbabwe that will produce the 3D printable ink required for local construction projects.
LafargeHolcim’s 3D printing technology
LafargeHolcim’s concrete 3D printing process used in the project consists of a 3D printer with a robotic mechanical arm that deposits the proprietary ink into patterned layers that eventually make up the walls of a building.
The company’s technology and proprietary building materials have also been involved in several other 3D printing construction projects.
For instance, over the last couple of years, the firm has been working with GE Renewable Energy and Danish 3D printing construction company COBOD to develop 3D printed “record-tall” turbine towers. The partners successfully printed a 10-meter tall turbine tower last year, and the environmental benefits of the project were recently presented to world leaders at President Joe Biden’s climate summit.
LafargeHolcim has also been awarded a design-build contract for a 3D printed 40-meter pedestrian footbridge in preparation for the 2024 Olympic Games in Paris. The company forms part of a consortium made up of civil engineering firm Freyssinet, Levigne and Cheron Architects, computing and artificial intelligence (AI) firm Quadric and large scale 3D printing firm XtreeE, which will work together to construct the deck of the bridge entirely from 3D printed concrete.
LafargeHolcim has previously taken part in a collaborative 3D printing research and development project that sought to develop innovative 3D printing systems and materials for construction. Spanish construction consortium 3DCONS, of which LafargeHolcim is a part, hopes its research will enable the future automation of building construction, rehabilitation, and thermal insulation with 3D printing.

The KSI Alliance will work as a highly collaborative, integrated team to offer clients a “one-stop-shop” common business development and construction approach from pre-construction services phase to engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) project delivery.
The carbon capture projects will employ Svante’s solid sorbent technology to capture carbon dioxides directly from industrial post-combustion diluted flue gases as a non-intrusive “end-of-the-pipe’’ solution to produce pipeline-grade pure CO2 for safe storage.
“We are very proud to become the engineering and construction partner of Svante for the deployment of this novel technology, which allows us to leverage our expertise in building carbon capture plants”, said David Claggett, senior vice president, Kiewit Energy Group Inc. “New technologies have the greatest probability of success when deployed with an integrated project delivery approach by organizations skilled at driving cost and schedule certainty.”
“Kiewit is a market leader in North America for CCS deployment, having more than 5,500 tons/day of installed capacity to date with further 60,000 tons/day of FEED studies currently underway. Kiewit and Svante are ready and capable of taking the next phase of plant capacity scale-up on the path to decarbonization of hard-to-abate industries such as cement and blue hydrogen” said Claude Letourneau, President and CEO of Svante.
Through this collaboration, both companies intend to address the critical need of lowering the capital cost of the capture of the carbon dioxide emitted from industrial facilities in order to achieve the world’s net-zero carbon goals required to stabilize the climate. Leaders from industry, financial sectors and government agree on the enormity of the challenge and the critical need to deploy more than 2,000 carbon capture and carbon removal plants by 2040. This is equivalent of putting about two world-class plants into operation each week over the next 20 years.
About Svante
Svante offers companies in emissions-intensive industries a viable way to capture large-scale CO2 emissions from existing infrastructure, either for safe storage or to be used for further industrial use in a closed loop. With the ability to capture CO2 directly from industrial sources at less than half the capital cost of existing solutions, Svante makes industrial-scale carbon capture a reality. Svante’s technology is currently being deployed in the field at pilot plant-scale by industry leaders in the energy and cement manufacturing sectors. The CO2MENT Pilot Plant Project – a partnership between Lafarge (Holcim) and TotalEnergies – is operating a 1 tonne per day (TPD) plant in Richmond, British Columbia, Canada that will re-inject captured CO2 into concrete, while the construction and commissioning of a 30 TPD demonstration plant was completed in 2019 at an industrial facility in Lloydminster, Saskatchewan, Canada. A 25 TPD demonstration plant is currently under design and construction at Chevron U.S.A. located near Bakersfield, California. In addition, several feasibility studies for commercial scale carbon capture projects ranging from 500 to 4,500 TPD are underway in North America and Europe.
Svante has partnered with Kiewit to provide engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) services for two US DOE funded carbon capture projects. On September 1, 2020, the United States Department of Energy’s National Energy Laboratory Technology (DOE-NETL) awarded $1,500,000 in federal funding for cost-shared development to support the initial engineering analysis and advancement of the LH CO2MENT Colorado first-of-a-kind commercial project of up to 1.5 million tonnes per year of CO2; and $13,000,000 in federal funding for the cost-shared development to support the design, construction and operation of a second-of-a-kind engineering-scale carbon capture plant at Chevron’s Kern River oil field in the San Joaquin Valley, California.
Svante has attracted more than USD$195 million in investment since it was founded in 2007 including the recent CDN$25 million investment from the Government of Canada’s Strategic Innovation Fund. Svante is building scalable supply chain for active capture materials to address a broad carbon capture and removal solutions offering at Gigaton scale. Svante’s Board of Directors includes Nobel Laureate and former Secretary of Energy, Steven Chu, and Chairman Steven Berkenfeld, former Head of Industrial & Cleantech Practice at Barclays Capital.

Construction Materials
At a handful of smelters throughout Quebec, mining and metals giant Rio Tinto extracts pure aluminum metal from the oxide alumina. The process happens in electrolytic cells, known colloquially as pots, at roughly 1,000 C. Due to the prodigious amount of energy involved and repeated use, the lining that coats these pots eventually breaks down, resulting in a hazardous waste that’s typically been processed and then sent to landfills.
A new project launched last fall, however, means tens of thousands of tonnes of treated potlining will find a second life in construction. Lafarge Canada and Geocycle Canada — both subsidiaries of LafargeHolcim — and Rio Tinto, announced the new circular economy project last October.
After being processed into a product the companies call Alextra at Rio Tinto’s Potlining Treatment Plant in Saguenay-Lac-St Jean, Que., the revamped material makes its way to Lafarge’s cement production plant in Bath, Ontario. There, it’s used during clinker production as the required alumina material. The long chain comes to an end when concrete with Alextra-infused cement is put to use on building projects throughout eastern Canada.
Contractors pouring the end product would never know the difference, but the new initiative could divert up to 80,000 tonnes of potlining from landfills and see it integrated into roughly a million tonnes of cement each year.
The research and development effort has been years in the making. Like other additives — fly ash and silica fume being a couple of the best known byproducts added to cement in Canada — Alextra will cut down on the need to mine or source raw materials to produce cement.
The new initiative is just one small part of the wider recycling and reuse ecosystem at Geocycle.
“We’re open to almost any waste, even hazardous waste, that we can recycle,” says Sophie Wu, head of Geocycle North America. There are just two requirements, she adds. “Waste that provides thermal energy, or can be ingredients of cement.”
On the ingredient side, byproducts from industries across Canada that offer iron, silica, alumina, or lime to Lafarge’s raw mix are considered. Foundry sands, fluid cracking catalysts, slags, iron fines and mill scale are a few of the most common.
When it comes to thermal energy-producing waste, which replaces some of the coal or natural gas firing Lafarge’s kilns, Geocycle’s inputs run the gamut. Using a method known as co-processing, waste material such as biomass, recycled wood, spent tires and agricultural products that have no other uses are added to cement kilns. The energy they contain is consumed during the combustion process and some of their minerals integrated into the resulting cement. Even items like used shampoo bottles that cannot be sent to landfills are put to use generating thermal energy, while the process also locks in their contaminants that could otherwise escape into soil or groundwater if the products reached landfills.
One of the few restrictions is on waste that can be reused elsewhere. Wu notes the company makes a point of not competing with high grade recycling, and is more often than not “getting rid of peoples’ headaches.”
From making use of approximately 3,000 tonnes of end-of-life tires at its Brookfield, N.S cement plant each year, to utilizing roughly 100,000 tonnes of waste typically bound for landfills each year at its facility in Richmond, B.C., co-processing has come to play an important role in trimming carbon dioxide emissions at Lafarge plants. Across its global operations since 1990, LafargeHolcim has reduced emissions by 25 per cent per tonne of cement produced.
Getting to zero CO2 emissions is the company’s ultimate goal, though both practical and technical obstacles will need to be overcome.
With the increased international focus on climate change, the wider cement industry is also working to slash emissions. Last fall, LafargeHolcim and the more than three dozen other large producers that make up the Global Cement and Concrete Association, signed a net zero “climate ambition” aiming for carbon neutral concrete by 2050.
Canada, along with other regions around the world, are now putting together technology road maps to get to zero, says Adam Auer, vice-president of Environment & Sustainability at the Cement Association of Canada (CAC).
If the industry hits its targets, the effect will be considerable. According to a commonly cited 2018 study from think tank Chatham House, roughly eight per cent of global CO2 emissions are tied to cement manufacturing. The combustion of fuels to make clinker, which requires heating kilns to approximately 1,500 C, is particularly energy intensive, accounting for about 30 per cent of emissions, Auer says. Process emissions, the result of chemical processes that take place in the kiln, account for the majority of the rest. To cut back across the board, companies are working on ways to reduce both the amount of clinker in cement and the amount of cement in concrete.
For its part, Lafarge Canada launched a new product range called ECOPact last November. The range offers a quantified reduction in CO2 of between 30 and 70 per cent, achieved by a process of mix design, optimization and material selection. The company is also working on and committed to launching a carbon neutral mix in the future.
The wider industry is taking a similar route to lower carbon concrete and emerging carbon capture technologies, Auer says.
Lehigh Cement, a unit of HeidelbergCement, for instance, launched a new line of cement called EcoCemPLUS last month. Produced at the company’s Edmonton plant through inter-grinding clinker, fly ash, limestone and gypsum, the mix is now available across the Canadian Prairies. It reduces emissions 22 per cent, compared to the company’s general use product.
The producer also teamed up with the International CCS Knowledge Centre in 2019 and began mapping out a business case for carbon capture technology at its Edmonton plant. It is now working on engineering design, targeting late 2021 to complete the feasibility work. Across the Atlantic, it is already developing a full-scale capture and storage project at a cement plant in Norway.
As the term implies, carbon capture does not prevent the initial release of CO2 but contains the emissions at the plant before they can escape. The CO2 can then be stored, or put to use for other purposes, though currently, options are limited.
“At the moment, the only real economic use for it at scale is to store it either through enhanced oil recovery or through just straight up geologic storage,” Auer says, noting Canada hosts favourable conditions for both.
To hit its mid-century climate pledge, as well as its intermediary CO2 reduction target of 20 per cent by 2030, LafargeHolcim sees carbon capture as a “must.” It is experimenting with capture technologies in 20 separate pilot projects around the world, including one at the Richmond cement plant designed to capture flue gas typically released into the atmosphere.
Auer sees carbon capture as the future of cement production. He expects costs for the technology to fall as advances are made and more uses for the captured carbon emerge. He points to synthetic fuel, carbon-based nanomaterials and even manufactured aggregates as a few examples of possible uses.
“Using captured CO2 to create synthetic aggregates would replace the virgin aggregates that would normally go into concrete, avoiding both the quarrying of virgin aggregates but also sequestering all of that carbon,” he says.
Bringing concrete’s carbon footprint to zero will not happen all at once, but momentum is building, driven by both producers and end users.
“The majority of contractors are not there yet,” Wu says, but adds that leading builders, private owners and governments are pushing initiatives forward.
Last summer, the Canadian government said it was considering setting mandatory minimum requirements for the procurement of low-carbon concrete. In a request for information, calling on the construction industry to weigh in on the feasibility of establishing a baseline for cleaner concrete, Ottawa said the eventual requirements would begin by mandating the use of concrete that relies on Portland Limestone Cement. Now readily available, PLC reduces emissions by up to 10 per cent. If the federal government moves ahead with the initiative, the targets would get more aggressive from there.
Auer says the federal government is still working through its implementation process, but that he hopes to see PLC become the baseline for cement across the country.
“PLC is kind of a no-brainer solution,” he says. “You can reduce your emissions by up to 10 per cent and it doesn’t cost you any more money and most importantly, it doesn’t preclude any of the other decarbonization strategies that are coming online. So you can still use supplementary cementitious materials, you can still use these emerging mineralization technologies like CarbonCure and Solidia, and others that can basically be stacked on top of PLC.”
The CAC estimates all three levels of governments buy up to half of all construction materials in Canada, either directly or indirectly, so momentum on the public side would go a long way.
In the private sector, Auer says the association has been expecting demand for cleaner concrete to pick up for the past decade, but it is only recently that owners and buildings tenants are slowly becoming a force for change.
Today, lower carbon mixes come at a premium, but the benefits of minimizing embodied carbon and developing CO2-neutral buildings have businesses showing more willingness to foot the added bill. In the not too distant future, low, or even net zero concrete, may be table stakes in Canadian construction.

https://www.architectureanddesign.com.au/news/holcim-ecopact-launch,"Mon, 03 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Low Carbon Concrete to Revolutionise Construction Industry - Architecture and Design,"ECOPact, a low carbon concrete product range, has been unveiled this week by Holcim. The product is able to reduce the embodied carbon of buildings, infrastructure and homes.
With 20% of Australia’s annual greenhouse gas emissions derived from the construction industry, sourcing sustainable building materials has become increasingly important. ECOPact is able to reduce embodied carbon by 30-60 percent, compared to the Australian National Life Cycle Inventory Database basecase.
The ECOPact range includes the option to achieve carbon neutrality. ECOPactZERO uses accredited carbon offsets through Climate Active to reduce embodied carbon by 100%. Other products in the range are able to also significantly reduce embodied carbon emissions of constructions.
George Agriogiannis, Holcim’s CEO, says the company has continued to look at solutions to carbon emissions within the construction industry, and believes that ECOPact is a product that can significantly reduce the industry’s carbon footprint.
“I am proud to announce our commitment to help our customers reduce the embodied carbon of concrete construction. We pride ourselves on being a solutions provider. ECOPact and ECOPactZERO are a substantial shift towards sustainable construction in Australia.”
For a structure like the Sydney Harbour Bridge, using ECOPact to achieve a 60% embodied carbon reduction is the equivalent of removing 14,700 cars off the road for one year, outlining its ability to significantly reduce emissions.
ECOPact and ECOPactZERO make it easy for customers to meet evolving tender requirements that stipulate embodied carbon reductions.
Grant Hartwig, Co-owner of Cairns residential builder MyStyle Homes, says ECOPact is a product that will enable the company to ensure it is building homes mindfully and sustainably.
“We live and work with the Great Barrier Reef at our doorstep. Climate change is the greatest threat to this region. It is critical for us as a business to lower our carbon footprint. Holcim is providing us with credible solutions to do this”.
CEO and Co-Founder of Edge Environment, Jonas Bengtsson also gives the concrete a ringing endorsement.
“Holcim is a leader when it comes to providing technically robust, evidence-based solutions. ECOPact is another great example of their commitment to sustainability, backed by science,” he says.
Every ECOPact product is supported by an Environmental Product Declaration (EPD), that provides customers with the ability to understand the impact of the materials supplied into their projects.

https://www.globalcement.com/news/item/13329-update-on-holcim-november-2021,"Wed, 24 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT","Update on Holcim, November 2021 - Cement industry news from Global Cement - Global Cement","Holcim’s investors’ event last week confirmed the changes the company has been making to its sales mix. At its Capital Markets Day it revealed its commitment to expand the net sales of its Solutions & Products division to 30% of the group total by 2025. This division covers products such as roofing, mortar, precast concrete and asphalt. At the same time it is reducing the proportion of sales from its cement division. Graph 1, below, from a presentation given by chief executive officer Jans Jenisch, hints at what group may be aiming for: roughly a third of its sales from cement; a third from aggregates and ready mixed concrete; and a third from the Solutions & Products division in 2025.
Graph 1: Forecast growth of sales by Holcim’s Solutions & Products division to 2025. Source: Holcim Capital Markets Day 2021 presentations on website.
To give readers an idea of the scale of change in Holcim’s cement business since the merger with Lafarge in 2015, just look at the figures. In 2015 LafargeHolcim sold 256Mt of cement and it had a cement production capacity of 374Mt/yr. In 2020 it sold 190Mt of cement and it had a cement production capacity of 288Mt/yr. However, the ratio of sales from cement has remained consistent at just below 60%.
This all changed in January 2021 when Holcim announced it was buying roofing and building envelope producer Firestone Building Products for US$3.4bn. Instead of trimming down the business to make synergistic changes as it had been for the previous five years the group significantly changed its sales mix. As noted in ‘2021 in Cement’ in the December 2021 issue of Global Cement Magazine, Holcim remains the world’s largest non-Chinese cement producer. Yet its acquisitions in 2021 have consisted of ready-mixed concrete and aggregate companies in mature markets, and Firestone. Its divestments have been cement subsidiaries. Since 2019, and including the agreed Brazilian sale, planned to complete in 2022, the group has generated US$4.1bn in these divestments. Almost as if to reinforce this change of direction the group also switched its name to Holcim in May 2021.
Aside from the focus on expanding the scope of the Solutions & Products division over the next few years, the group said at its recent investors’ event that it wants to lead in sustainability and innovation. It also reminded investors that growth remains in building materials markets. Once Jenisch had established the potential the construction market has in the coming years it was all about so-called ‘green’ growth. On the sustainability side this includes promoting the group’s Science Based Targets initiative net-zero targets by 2050, pushing sales of its low-carbon concrete products and working on increasing the uptake of construction and demolition waste in Europe. The group has a target of reaching 25% or higher for sales of its ECOPact ready-mixed concrete product by 2025. Holcim reported Scope 1 CEM specific CO2 net emissions of 555kgCO2/t in 2020 and it has target of 475kgCO2/t by 2030. This is broadly in line with its peers. Cemex has also committed to 475kgCO2/t or lower and HeidelbergCement is currently aiming for 500kgCO2/t or lower by 2030.
Simultaneously promoting sustainability and growth in products that release CO2 during their manufacture is quite the balancing act for all cement producers. The way Holcim appears to be squaring this particular circle is by heading elsewhere. Back in January 2021 we asked whether Holcim would leave it with the Firestone acquisition or go further. This question has now been answered with Holcim’s intent to increase the share of its Solutions & Products to 30% by 2025. Other large cement producers don’t seem to be diversifying their sales mix at the same speed but similar strategic thinking along supply chains can be seen from the proposed buyer of LafargeHolcim Brazil, Companhia Siderúrgica Nacional (CSN) Cimentos. CSN is a steel manufacturer and buying cement assets gives it somewhere to use its slag. Fittingly, Holcim’s investors’ day ended with a night out at a museum holding an exhibition on the history of concrete. For now at least concrete looks set to remain a key part of the business.","To give readers an idea of the scale of change in Holcim’s cement business since the merger with Lafarge in 2015, just look at the figures.

https://news.bloomberglaw.com/environment-and-energy/concrete-still-a-barrier-to-climate-friendly-infrastructure-plan,"Tue, 25 May 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Concrete Still a Barrier to Climate-Friendly Infrastructure Plan (bloomberglaw.com) - Bloomberg Law,"President Joe Biden’s goal of halving greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 doesn’t square with his plan to rebuild the nation’s crumbling roads and bridges, unless he rethinks the main ingredient in virtually every major infrastructure project in U.S. history: concrete.
Concrete is responsible for at least 7% of climate-change-fueling carbon dioxide emissions worldwide, according to clean energy research group BloombergNEF. Other groups, such as the Yale School of the Environment, put that estimate even higher, at 8%.
While cleaner “green concrete” is being used in states—including some that are dangling tax credits for builders to adopt the new materials—the White House hasn’t insisted on its inclusion in federal projects or highlighted concrete’s carbon footprint as prominently as it has the impacts of gas-powered cars and fossil fuel-based energy.
“It’s bizarre that it hasn’t come up more,” said Gregor Robertson, the former mayor of Vancouver, British Columbia, which recently adopted a plan to cut the carbon content of materials for new construction projects. “You have a huge infrastructure plan, but you’re not making a bold climate action commitment.”
The stakes are also being elevated by ongoing talks between the White House and congressional leaders on what could rank among the nation’s largest-ever infrastructure spends.
“You only get to build that giant project, that road, once,” said New York state Sen. Todd Kaminsky (D), who wrote one of the nation’s most ambitious green concrete bills. “You can’t just switch the concrete out a few years from now. So the sooner we get these preferences in place, the better.”
While Biden’s original plan called for more than $2 trillion in spending, even a compromise infrastructure package would be expected to fund the pouring of millions of tons of new concrete for everything from roads and bridges to ports and waterways.
Switching to a cement that’s even 10% to 15% less carbon intensive, and just for the highway and bridge modernization part of the Biden plan, would cut emissions by the equivalent of taking 500,000 to 750,000 cars off the road for a year, the Natural Resources Defense Council estimates.
“Not doing that is an enormous missed opportunity,” said Sasha Stashwick, senior advocate at NRDC’s climate and clean energy program.
New and Expensive
The prime climate culprit in concrete is cement, the gluey mixture that binds crushed stone together into a rock-hard substance. Cement production releases carbon in two ways: from the chemical reaction that results when calcium carbonate is broken down, and from the enormous heat levels that must be reached.
So far there’s no announced plan from the Biden administration to require green concrete in return for U.S. infrastructure dollars. The White House didn’t respond to questions about whether it would take steps to mandate or incentivize low-carbon building materials.
Part of the problem could be availability. The green cement industry is still in its infancy, and there’s no formal market for it, said Julia Attwood, lead analyst for sustainable materials at BloombergNEF.
Users who want it—and are willing to pay a premium for it—must partner with a large cement producer.
And the most expensive green cements, which abate the greatest portion of greenhouse gas emissions, can be twice the price of conventional cement, Attwood said.
At this point, a mandate requiring all new cement to be green could be “enormously disruptive” depending on how “green” is defined, said Attwood.
“If it simply means a bit more sustainable than traditional cement and concrete, that could be done relatively quickly and easily by using recycled inputs,” she said. “If green means net zero, then huge amounts of carbon capture or carbon offsets would need to be deployed to achieve it.”
But Nathanael Greene, senior renewable energy policy analyst at NRDC, said projects could be planned now with the expectation that the market will grow and green concrete prices will drop.
“Some of the newer technologies, like carbon mineralization and novel cements, do come with a premium, but that is more of a reflection of their early stage and scale,” he said. “As they scale and become more common, prices will decline.”
Cement’s Climate Footprint
If the cement industry was a country, it would be the third-highest emitter in the world after China and the U.S., according to the Yale School of the Environment.
Because cement production is implicated in most of the greenhouse gas emissions in concrete, the green concrete industry broadly speaking finds ways to use low- or zero-emitting cement substitutes to bind together the loose aggregate. Many green concrete companies have sprouted up in recent years, each with their own proprietary approach.
In a fact sheet accompanying the infrastructure proposal, the White House said Biden’s plan would establish 10 pilot projects to demonstrate carbon capture retrofits for large cement, steel, and chemical production facilities. It also said “his investments will use more sustainable and innovative materials, including cleaner steel and cement.”
A separate statement mentioned the need to use carbon capture technology and green hydrogen to reduce cement-making’s carbon footprint.
They’re important steps to lay the groundwork for research and development on emission-cutting technologies that face “unique risks and financial hurdles,” said Stashwick.
But Robertson, who now works in the industry, said they’re not enough.
“It’s critical that governments at all levels start regulating the embodied carbon in building materials so that reductions are the norm,” said Robertson, now executive vice president of strategy and partnerships at Nexii Building Solutions, a technology company specializing in green construction. “There will be big infrastructure and stimulus funding, and it should come with clear regulations to reduce the climate impacts of that infrastructure.”
Congressional Efforts
Congress has also made some gestures toward green concrete, but with few results.
Last year, Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Ore.) introduced a $500 billion surface transportation reauthorization bill that would have created a program to fund green construction materials and building practices. The measure was later included in the Moving Forward Act, which passed the House but wasn’t taken up in the Senate.
DeFazio plans to introduce similar provisions this year, said an aide with the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, which DeFazio chairs.
He’ll also push to include language in a surface transportation bill “encouraging the development and deployment of green construction materials and practices to create smarter, more efficient transportation systems, while creating millions of jobs at the same time,” the aide said.
‘Leadership at the State Level’
Some states are taking the lead in the absence of federal leadership.
Kaminsky introduced a bill in the New York legislature that would establish guidelines requiring the procurement of low-carbon concrete for state projects and set up a stakeholder advisory group to consider how to create incentives for green concrete production. An earlier version of the bill would have given a bidding advantage to companies that use low-carbon concrete and provided tax credits to those that document the embodied carbon emissions in their concrete.
Those kinds of innovative measures are still on the table for the stakeholder advisory group, said Stashwick. The bill has cleared the committee stage and is expected to be taken up for a full Senate floor vote shortly.
Big players in the state’s construction industry are already switching to green concrete, including LafargeHolcim, the biggest concrete maker in the world, which is evaluating the equipment at its plant in Ravena, N.Y., and designing a system that can produce low-carbon cement, Kaminsky said.
“You gain synergies when you act regionally,” he said. “It’s very rare to have cement producers who only sell cement to one state. Once New York has cracked the code for this, other states will want to. Once it’s there and available, why would you not try to help the earth?”
New York ranked eighth in the nation in cement consumption in 2020, according to the Portland Cement Association, a concrete trade group.
In New Jersey, the state Senate passed a bill in March that would provide tax incentives to builders that use low-carbon concrete. It would also require builders to offer concrete products that use “carbon footprint-reducing technology” as an option in new construction. A companion version is ready for a floor vote in the state assembly.
California lawmakers, too, are working on a bill that would require the California Air Resources Board to come up with a strategy to cut greenhouse gases from the cement and concrete industries by 40% by 2030, and to reach carbon neutrality no later than 2045. The Senate passed the bill on Monday.
“I do think you see leadership at the state level,” said Sean Monkman, chair of the sustainability committee at the American Concrete Institute and senior vice president of technology development at CarbonCure Technologies Inc.
“It’s just a matter of the U.S. having 50 different ideas of how to do something,” Monkman said. “If you have federal leadership, it can align some of these efforts and incentivize action where it might not be a priority.”
Next-Gen Concrete
Several companies are developing low-carbon cement and concrete substitutes.
CarbonCure has developed a way of making concrete mixes out of captured carbon dioxide; the company recently won an XPrize for its technology.
Similarly, Nexii has developed a proprietary cement and concrete alternative called Nexiite, which the company claims has a lower carbon footprint than traditional concrete and also lowers the amount of building components needed.
Biomason uses natural microorganisms to create cement in ambient temperatures without carbon emissions. The company says its product is three times stronger than traditional cement.
Federal legislation or regulation that incentivizes the use of green building materials will be critical to its widespread adoption, said Katie Bailey, Biomason’s brand communications manager.
“Stronger regulation or a stronger stance on pushing us into the future is a benefit to everyone,” Bailey said. “It’s going to free up more funding for organizations like ours to really disrupt these industries that have been the same for a long time. And one of the only ways to do that is through incentives.”

Nearly $14.5 Million Awarded in Third Round of Commercial and Industrial Carbon Challenge
December 21, 2021
The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) today announced nearly $14.5 million in awards to the third-round winners of the Commercial and Industrial (C&I) Carbon Challenge as part of the Regional Economic Development Council Initiative Consolidated Funding Application (CFA) Round XI awards announced by Governor Kathy Hochul last week. The seven winning companies have committed to high-impact actions that will shrink their carbon footprints and result in a reduction of over 1.2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide, the equivalent of taking approximately 260,000 cars off the road per year. Today’s announcement supports the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 85 percent by 2050 and advance a just transition for difficult-to-decarbonize and energy-intensive economic sectors.
Doreen M. Harris, President and CEO, NYSERDA said, “With each round of C&I Carbon Challenge awards, the State is supporting high impact clean energy projects that help some of the largest energy users reduce their carbon footprint. These commercial and industrial businesses are making commitments to energy efficiency and reducing on-site emissions from their operations that will improve their communities while serving as an example of climate action for other large energy users.”
Launched in May 2018 and administered by NYSERDA, the C&I Carbon Challenge is a competitive program that provides funding to large commercial and industrial energy users such as manufacturers, colleges, health care facilities and office building owners in New York State to develop various cost-effective clean energy projects that reduce carbon emissions. With many large energy users located in disadvantaged communities, projects that help these companies reduce emissions help improve local air quality and provide local environmental benefits for these communities.
The winning proposals, submitted through the State’s annual CFA process, demonstrate the highest potential for cost-effectively implementing carbon-reducing clean energy actions. Projects that benefit disadvantaged communities received extra points in the scoring criteria when determining awards.
The awarded projects include:
New York City:
1411 Broadway, New York City working with SOCOTEC consultants, will pursue a portfolio of projects with a strategy to reduce heating and cooling loads, recover and reuse waste heat from exhaust air as much as possible, and supplement heating and cooling with more efficient heating ventilation and cooling technologies.
Columbia University Irving Medical Center will undertake a number of energy efficiency measures, including steam-to-hot water conversion in two buildings and installation of a heat recovery heat pump that will be leveraged to balance heating and cooling loads. This project is located in a disadvantaged community.
St. John’s University will implement several energy efficient projects over the next three years to reduce energy use and carbon emissions at their Queens, New York campus including converting existing steam-fired domestic hot water (DHW) generators to electric heat pump-based DHW generators in multiple campus buildings.
Western New York:
Cascades Containerboard Packaging Niagara Falls will install upgrades to an existing biodigester system to optimize purification, resulting in reduced fossil fuel emissions. This project is located in a disadvantaged community.
Capital Region:
Essity Hygiene will be working with Ecosave, an energy services provider, across two facilities: a paper mill located in South Glen Falls and a packaging and finishing facility located in Greenwich, to install a suite of energy saving measures as part of the first phase of a comprehensive energy efficiency portfolio plan.
Holcim (US) Inc. will undertake a plant retrofit that will allow the facility to shift to production of cement with lower carbon emissions. In order to facilitate the formula change to lower emissions, they will implement a series of capital projects at their plant in Ravena, New York.
Mid-Hudson:
IBM Corporation will pursue a portfolio of 16 energy efficiency measures at three locations in Armonk, Poughkeepsie, and Yorktown Heights, including heating ventilation and cooling (HVAC) upgrades, the installation of a geothermal heating system, and datacenter cooling upgrades.
MACNY President & CEO Randy Wolken said, “Congratulations to all of the winners of the C&I Carbon Challenge. With these project awards, New York is assisting companies to grow in a post-covid world. NYSERDA’s Carbon Challenge continues to provide critical support to companies to continue New York’s tradition of excellence in manufacturing while maintaining environmentally sustainable operations.”
Empire State Development President & CEO Hope Knight said, “We are proud to support innovative projects that support New York State’s clean energy goals. These strategic plans and investments are informed by regional stakeholders to revitalize a range of buildings across industries and uses, in ways that will contribute to a greener economy.""
New York State Department of Labor Commissioner Roberta Reardon said, “I applaud Governor Hochul and NYSERDA for these innovative incentives which are helping to reduce our State’s carbon footprint and build a cleaner New York. We need to engage as many partners as possible in this effort, and the C&I Carbon Challenge assists businesses in making real changes that will have a meaningful impact on our environment for decades to come.”
With today’s announcement, more than $31 million has been awarded through the C&I Carbon Challenge for projects that are reducing carbon emissions to improve statewide sustainability and combat climate change. Past awardees, including third round winners, have consisted of colleges and universities, office buildings and businesses in a variety of manufacturing sectors. Collectively, they have committed to reducing over 2.7 million metric tons of carbon emissions, the equivalent of taking approximately 585,000 cars off the road.
Commercial and industrial buildings account for 33 percent of the energy-related greenhouse gas emissions in New York State. NYSERDA's initiatives and programs can benefit most businesses and organizations across the State, but large energy consumers have unique needs, and solutions, when it comes to increasing efficiency and lowering emissions. Building on New York State's support for private sector solutions to lower the cost of clean energy, the C&I Carbon Challenge gives large energy consumers the flexibility to tap into their in-house expertise to reduce their carbon footprint and control their energy costs.
Funding for this program is available through the State's 10-year, $6 billion Clean Energy Fund.
New York State's Nation-Leading Climate Act
New York State's nation-leading climate agenda is the most aggressive climate and clean energy initiative in the nation, calling for an orderly and just transition to clean energy that creates jobs and continues fostering a green economy as New York State recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic. Enshrined into law through the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act, New York is on a path to achieve its mandated goal of a zero-emission electricity sector by 2040, including 70 percent renewable energy generation by 2030, and to reach economy wide carbon neutrality. It builds on New York's unprecedented investments to ramp-up clean energy including over $33 billion in 102 large-scale renewable and transmission projects across the state, $6.8 billion to reduce buildings emissions, $1.8 billion to scale up solar, more than $1 billion for clean transportation initiatives, and over $1.6 billion in NY Green Bank commitments. Combined, these investments are supporting nearly 158,000 jobs in New York's clean energy sector in 2020, a 2,100 percent growth in the distributed solar sector since 2011 and a commitment to develop 9,000 megawatts of offshore wind by 2035. Under the Climate Act, New York will build on this progress and reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 85 percent from 1990 levels by 2050, while ensuring that at least 35 percent with a goal of 40 percent of the benefits of clean energy investments are directed to disadvantaged communities, and advance progress towards the state's 2025 energy efficiency target of reducing on-site energy consumption by 185 trillion BTUs of end-use energy savings.

https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/environment-plastic-cement/,"Thu, 28 Oct 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Big brands stoke cement kilns with plastic waste as recycling falters - Reuters,"Consumer goods giants are funding projects to send plastic trash to cement plants, where it is burned as cheap energy. They’re touting it as a way to keep plastic out of dumps and use less fossil fuel. Critics say it undercuts recycling efforts and worsens air quality. One said it was “like moving the landfill from the ground to the sky.”
Trash and burn
The global consumer goods industry’s plans for dealing with the vast plastic waste it generates can be seen here in a landfill on the outskirts of Indonesia’s capital, where a swarm of excavators tears into stinking mountains of garbage.
These machines are unearthing rubbish to provide fuel to power a nearby cement plant. Discarded bubble wrap, take-out containers and single-use shopping bags have become one of the fastest-growing sources of energy for the world’s cement industry.
The Indonesian project, funded in part by Unilever PLC, maker of Dove soap and Hellmann’s mayonnaise, is part of a worldwide effort by big multinationals to burn more plastic waste in cement kilns, Reuters has detailed for the first time.
This “fuel” is not only cheap and abundant. It’s the centerpiece of a partnership between consumer products giants and cement companies aimed at burnishing their environmental credentials. They’re promoting this approach as a win-win for a planet choking on plastic waste. Converting plastic to energy, these companies contend, keeps it out of landfills and oceans while allowing cement plants to move away from burning coal, a major contributor to global warming.
Reuters has identified nine collaborations launched over the last two years between various combinations of consumer goods giants and major cement makers. Four leading sources of plastic packaging are involved: The Coca-Cola Company, Unilever, Nestle S.A. and Colgate-Palmolive Company. On the cement side of the deals are four top producers: Switzerland’s Holcim Group, Mexico’s Cemex SAB de CV, PT Solusi Bangun Indonesia Tbk (SBI) and Republic Cement & Building Material Inc, a company in the Philippines.
These projects span the world, from Costa Rica to the Philippines, El Salvador to India. In Indonesia, for instance, Unilever is partnering with SBI, one of that country’s largest cement makers.
The alliances come as the cement industry – the source of 7% of the world’s carbon dioxide emissions – faces rising pressure to reduce these greenhouse gases. Consumer brands, meanwhile, are feeling the heat from lawmakers who are banning or taxing single-use plastic packaging and pushing so-called polluter-pays legislation to make producers bear the costs of its clean up.
Critics say there’s little green about burning plastic, which is derived from oil, to make cement. A dozen sources with direct knowledge of the practice, among them scientists, academics and environmentalists, told Reuters that plastic burned in cement kilns emits harmful air emissions and amounts to swapping one dirty fuel for another. More importantly, environmental groups say, it’s a strategy that could potentially undercut efforts spreading globally to boost recycling rates and dramatically slash the production of single-use plastic.
Less than 10% of all the plastic ever made has been recycled, in large part because it’s too costly to collect and sort. Plastic production, meanwhile, is projected to double within 20 years.
Such thinking is naive, said Axel Pieters, chief executive of Geocycle, the waste-management arm of Holcim Group, one of the world’s largest cement makers and partner with Nestle, Unilever and Coca-Cola in plastic-fuel ventures. Pieters told Reuters that burning plastic in cement kilns is a safe, inexpensive and practical solution that can dispose of huge volumes of this trash quickly. Less than 10% of all the plastic ever made has been recycled, in large part because it’s too costly to collect and sort. Plastic production, meanwhile, is projected to double within 20 years.
“Thinking that we recycle waste only, and that we should avoid plastic waste, then you can quote me on this: People believe in fairy tales,” Pieters said.
Unilever would not comment specifically on the Indonesia project. It said in an email that in situations where recycling isn’t feasible, it would explore “energy recovery initiatives.” That’s industry parlance for burning plastic as fuel.
Coca-Cola, Unilever, Colgate and Nestle did not respond to questions about the environmental and health impacts of burning plastic in cement kilns. The companies said they invest in various initiatives to reduce waste, including boosting recycled content in their packaging and making refillable containers.
Cemex, SBI, Republic Cement and Holcim’s Geocycle unit told Reuters their partnerships with consumer goods firms were aimed at addressing the global waste crisis and reducing their dependence on traditional fossil fuels.
Exactly how much plastic waste is being burned in cement kilns globally isn’t known. That’s because industry statistics typically lump it into a wider category called “alternative fuel” that comprises other garbage, such as scrap wood, old vehicle tires and clothing.
The use of alternative fuel has risen steadily in recent decades and already is the dominant energy source for the cement industry in some European countries. There’s no question the amount of plastic within that category has increased and will keep climbing given a worldwide explosion of plastic waste, according to 20 cement industry players interviewed for this report, including company executives, engineers and analysts. Reuters also reviewed data from cement associations, individual countries and analysts that confirmed this trend.
For example, Geocycle currently uses 2 million tonnes of plastic waste a year as alternative fuel at Holcim plants worldwide, according to Geocycle CEO Pieters, who said the company intends to increase this to 11 million tonnes by 2040, including through more partnerships with consumer goods companies.
Pieters said the cement industry has the capacity to burn all the plastic waste the world currently produces. The United Nations Environment Programme estimates that figure to be 300 million tonnes annually. That dwarfs the world’s plastic recycling capacity, estimated to be 46 million tonnes a year, according to a 2018 estimate by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), a global policy forum.
Plastic pollution, meanwhile, is bedeviling communities whose landfills are reaching capacity and despoiling the Earth’s wild places. Plastic garbage flowing into the oceans is due to triple to 29 million tonnes a year by 2040, according to a study published last year by the Pew Charitable Trusts. This detritus is endangering wildlife and contaminating the seafood humans consume.
“The cement industry is definitely a solution,” Geocycle’s Pieters said.
Toxic emissions
Consumer goods giants are turning to cement firms for help in reducing plastic litter as other initiatives stumble. Reuters reported in July that a set of new “advanced” plastic recycling technologies promoted by big brands and the plastic industry had suffered major setbacks across the world.
Cement-making is one of the world’s most energy-intensive businesses. Fuel – mainly coal – is its single-biggest expense, industry executives said. In the 1970s, producers looking to reduce costs began stoking kilns with rubbish such as tires, biomass, sewage sludge – and plastic. Those materials aren’t as efficient as coal, but are virtually free. Some local governments even pay cement makers to take this waste.
In Europe, refuse now makes up roughly half the fuel used by the cement industry. In Germany, the bloc’s biggest producer, the ratio is 70%, according to 2019 data from the Global Cement & Concrete Association (GCCA), a London-based trade organization. The United States uses 15% alternative fuel in its kilns, according to the Portland Cement Association, a U.S. industry group. Spokesperson Mike Zande said its members have the capacity to catch up with Europe.
While cost-cutting remains the primary driver, the industry in recent years has begun touting its garbage fuel as a way to reduce the “societal problem” of plastic waste, said Ian Riley, CEO of the London-based World Cement Association (WCA), which represents producers in developing countries.
So it was logical that cement makers would team up with consumer goods companies, the largest source of single-use plastic packaging, in the recent partnerships to burn discarded plastic in their kilns.
In emerging markets, big brands sell a slew of food and hygiene products packaged in plastic sachets, typically single-serving portions tailored to the budgets of poor households. Billions of these flexible pouches are sold each year. Sachets are nearly impossible to recycle because they’re made of layers of different materials laminated together, usually plastic and aluminum, that are difficult to separate.
Indonesia, an archipelago of more than 270 million people, is the second-largest contributor to ocean plastic pollution behind China, partly due to its widespread use of sachets, according to a 2015 study published in the journal Science. Plastic garbage can be seen everywhere around Jakarta, the sprawling capital of more than 10 million people. It clogs storm drains, litters its teaming slums and mars its shoreline.
Developing countries have generally welcomed assistance with waste management. Thus Indonesia was a natural location for Unilever’s waste-fuel venture with cement maker SBI and the local Jakarta government. At last year’s launch, Andono Warih, head of Jakarta’s environment service, praised the initiative and expressed hope that it would spark other such collaborations.
The project uses plastic that’s already been buried in the region’s Bantar Gebang landfill, one of the largest dumps in Asia. Waste excavated by earth-moving equipment is transported to a warehouse at the landfill site. There, it is shredded, sieved and dried into a brown mix resembling manure. That material, known as Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF), is then fed into the kiln at an SBI cement plant in Narogong, just outside Jakarta.
SBI currently uses 20% RDF at that plant, a figure that could increase to 35%, according to Ita Sadono, SBI’s business development manager. The operation still relies primarily on coal, she said, but she contends RDF is “significantly helping to reduce plastic waste.”
Unilever is helping to fund a second RDF project in Cilacap, an industrial region in Central Java, according to SBI and a 2020 sustainability report by Unilever’s local Indonesian unit. The two facilities could send 30,000 tonnes of plastic waste per year to SBI’s cement plants, according to a Reuters analysis of data provided by SBI.
Unilever did not respond to detailed questions about these projects. Sadono said in a text message that Reuters’ calculations were “OK,” without giving further details.
“People here are breathing dust every day.”
About two kilometers from SBI’s cement plant near Jakarta, Dadan bin Anton, 63, runs a roadside stall selling plastic sachets of soap, washing powder and instant coffee, including brands owned by Unilever. He said he often has trouble breathing and blames the cement plant.
“People here are breathing dust every day,” he said.
SBI has invested in mitigation measures to cut dust at its plants, Sadono said. And it isn’t clear whether the cement facility has anything to do with Dadan’s burning chest. Jakarta boasts some of the dirtiest air in Asia. Pollutants from industry smokestacks, agricultural fires and auto exhaust routinely blanket the city.
But some scientists say incinerated plastic is a dangerous new ingredient to add to the mix, particularly in developing nations where air-quality rules often are weak and enforcement spotty.
Plastic releases harmful substances like dioxins and furans when burned, said Paul Connett, a retired professor of environmental chemistry and toxicology at St. Lawrence University in Canton, New York, who has studied the poisonous byproducts of burning waste. If enough of those pollutants escape from a cement kiln, they can be hazardous for humans and animals in the surrounding area, Connett said.
Such fears are overblown, said Claude Lorea, cement director at GCCA, the industry group representing big cement firms including Holcim and Cemex. She said super-heated kilns destroy all toxins resulting from burning any alternative fuel, including plastic and hazardous waste.
But things can go wrong.
In 2014, a cement plant in Austria released hexachlorobenzene (HCB), a highly toxic substance and suspected human carcinogen, after the facility burned industrial waste contaminated with the pollutant. Cheese and milk sourced from cattle raised near that plant in southern Carinthia state were tainted, Austria’s health and food safety agency found. And blood samples drawn from area residents also contained HCB, which can damage the nervous system, liver and thyroid.
An investigation commissioned by the state government found multiple failures by local regulators and the cement plant, including that the kiln was not running hot enough to destroy contaminants like HCB.
The Austrian cement maker which operates the plant, w&p Zement GmbH, told Reuters that it had worked to eliminate all the environmental pollution from the incident and that it had provided help to the community such as replacing contaminated animal feed.
Carinthia province spokesperson Gerd Kurath said in an email that the government’s continued monitoring of air, soil and water samples in the area shows that contamination levels have declined.
The cement industry, meanwhile, is heralding waste-to-fuel as a way to fight global warming. That’s because burning refuse, including plastic, emits fewer greenhouse gases than coal, the GCCA trade group said.
Burning garbage “reduces our fossil fuel reliance,” spokesperson Lorea said. “It’s climate neutral.”
The European Commission, which sets emission rules in Europe, told Reuters that plastic does emit fewer carbon dioxide emissions than coal but more than natural gas, another fuel used by the cement industry.
“The cement industry should leap-frog the whole burning-waste paradigm and move to clean fuel.”
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which regulates environmental policy in the world’s largest economy, reached a different conclusion. It said in a statement there is no significant climate benefit to be gained from substituting plastic for coal, and that burning this waste in cement kilns can create harmful air pollution that must be monitored.
Measuring plastic’s CO2 emissions against those of coal, the world’s dirtiest fossil fuel, is not the benchmark to use if the cement industry is serious about fighting global warming, said Lee Bell, advisor to the International Pollutants Elimination Network, a global coalition working to eliminate toxic pollutants. Reducing the industry’s massive carbon emissions, he said, requires a switch to fuels such as green hydrogen, a more expensive but low-polluting fuel produced from water and renewable energy.
“The cement industry should leap-frog the whole burning-waste paradigm and move to clean fuel,” Bell said.
The GCCA told Reuters the industry is improving energy efficiency and is considering the use of green hydrogen.
Ever more plastic
While cement plants in industrialized countries are gearing up to burn more plastic, explosive growth is anticipated in the developing world.
China and India together account for 60% of the world’s cement production in facilities whose primary fuel is coal. Over the next decade, these countries have set targets of using alternative fuel to stoke 20% to 30% of their output. If they reached just a 10% threshold, that would equate to burning 63 million tonnes of plastic annually, up from 6 million tonnes now, according to SINTEF, a Norwegian scientific research group. That’s more plastic waste than the United States generates each year.
In 2019, 170 countries agreed to “significantly reduce” their use of plastic by 2030 as part of a United Nations resolution. But that measure is non-binding, and a proposed ban on single-use plastic by 2025 was opposed by several member states, including the United States.
Thus the waste-to-fuel option may well become an unstoppable juggernaut, said Matthias Mersmann, chief technology officer at KHD Humboldt Wedag International AG, a German engineering firm that supplies equipment to cement plants worldwide. Plastic waste is quickly outstripping countries’ capacity to bury or recycle it. Burning it eliminates large amounts of this material quickly, with little special handling or new facilities required. There are an estimated 3,000 or more cement plants worldwide. All are hungry for fuel.
“There’s only one thing that can hold up and break this trend, and that would be a very strong cut in the production of plastics,” Mersmann said. “Otherwise, there is nothing that can stop this.”
That momentum has some environmentalists worried, including Sander Defruyt, who heads a plastics initiative at the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, a United Kingdom-based nonprofit focused on sustainability. The foundation in 2018 worked out waste-reduction and recycling targets with Coca-Cola, Nestle, Unilever, Colgate-Palmolive and hundreds of other consumer brands.
Defruyt said the foundation does not support its partner companies’ pivot towards incineration. Burning plastic for cement fuel, he said, is a “quick fix” that risks giving consumer goods companies the green light to continue cranking out single-use plastic and could reduce the urgency to redesign packaging.
“If you can dump everything in a cement kiln, then why would you still care about the problem?” Defruyt said.
Coca-Cola, Nestle, Unilever and Colgate-Palmolive said their cement partnerships are just one of several strategies they’re pursuing to address the waste crisis.
‘Plastic prayers’
In the central England village of Cauldon, residents have complained in recent years to the local council and Britain’s environmental regulator about noise, dust and smoke coming from a nearby cement plant owned by Holcim. Those efforts have failed to derail the expansion of that facility to burn more plastic.
When completed next year, alternative fuel, including “non-recyclable” plastics such as potato chip bags, will account for up to 85% of the facility’s fuel, according to planning documents filed with local authorities on behalf of Geocycle, which will manage the project.
The move will recover energy from plastic waste otherwise destined for landfills, the documents said.
Cauldon resident Lucy Ford, 42, said the cement maker’s plans have only added to some villagers' fears about emissions. “They say they are the answer to all of our plastic prayers,” she said. “I don’t like the idea of it.”
Geocycle’s Pieters said he understood the community’s concerns. He said the company complies with all local regulations and that it carefully monitors the plant’s emissions, which would be lowered by the upgrades.
Britain’s Environment Agency said in an email that it took all complaints about the plant seriously. It said the Cauldon facility has a permit to burn waste and that the plant has to comply with its regulations.
“If you can dump everything in a cement kiln, then why would you still care about the problem?”
Back in Indonesia, Unilever and SBI told Reuters that using plastic for energy was preferable to leaving it in a landfill.
Local environmentalists say they are alarmed that cement kilns could be shaping up as the fix for a nation flooded with plastic waste.
It would allow consumer brands to continue business as usual, while adding to Indonesia’s air-quality woes, said Yobel Novian Putra, an advocate with the Global Alliance for Incinerator Alternatives, a coalition of groups working to eliminate waste.
“It’s like moving the landfill from the ground to the sky,” Putra said.

LafargeHolcim, ECOncrete shape offshore wind turbine scour protection
October 12, 2021October 12, 2021 Concrete News
Sources: LafargeHolcim, Chicago; CP staff
LafargeHolcim and specialty precast developer ECOncrete Tech Ltd. are teaming to design and fabricate scour protection units equal to offshore wind turbine foundations’ hydrodynamic loads, configured to facilitate marine organism growth, and meeting seabed stabilization standards. Their three-year research & development effort envisions a pilot project to evaluate units’ ecological performance in an offshore environment, ahead of full-scale installations.
LafargeHolcim and ECOncrete Tech researchers will pursue precast scour protection units that prevent currents from sweeping away sediments and resist the hydrodynamic force-rooted formation of holes around turbine foundations.
“Offshore energy production is a rapidly growing market worldwide, and while there are certainly benefits of using renewable energy, there is also an impact of structures on sensitive underwater ecosystems,” says ECOncrete Tech Co-Founder and CEO Dr. Ido Sella. “We view our collaboration with LafargeHolcim in the U.S. as key to minimizing this impact.”
“We recognize there are many paths to achieving our net zero commitment, and most require innovative partnerships and out-of-the-box thinking,” adds LafargeHolcim Vice President, Commercial Excellence Josep Maset, invoking parent company Holcim AG’s stand on carbon dioxide emissions reduction through 2050. “The work with ECOncrete Tech is a notable example of searching for solutions that enable increased use of renewable energy in an environmentally responsible way.”
A White House goal of creating 30 gigawatts of offshore wind turbine-derived power by 2030 calls for protecting biodiversity and promoting ocean co-use—goals hinging on technologies for sustaining marine environment and species. The scour protection that LafargeHolcim and ECOncrete target would be the first structural solution to address turbines’ ecological impacts on the marine environment.
Through a New York City office, Tel Aviv-based ECOncrete Tech has a five-year record of demonstrating marine organism-friendly precast concrete concepts, owing especially to New York Harbor, Long Island Sound and Port of San Diego block installations. Work with LafargeHolcim commenced earlier this year under a grant from the Binational Industrial Research and Development (BIRD) program, supported by the National Institute of Standards and Technology and Israel Ministry of Economy and Industry/Office of the Chief Scientist. A 2016 BIRD grant helped usher ECOncrete Tech into the North American market, Besser Co. its inaugural R&D partner.

https://canada.constructconnect.com/joc/news/technology/2021/07/lafarges-richmond-b-c-plant-hits-major-co2-capture-milestone,"Fri, 30 Jul 2021 07:00:00 GMT","Lafarge's Richmond, BC plant hits major CO2 capture milestone - constructconnect.com - Daily Commercial News","Despite the challenges caused by COVID-19, a first-of-its-kind pilot project to capture industrial levels of CO2emissions from the Lafarge Canada cement plant in Richmond, B.C., has reached a major milestone.
The transformative project, called CO2MENT, is part of the company’s drive to make Richmond the most carbon-efficient cement plant in Canada and could dramatically change the cement and concrete industry.
Carbon-capture technology developed by Svante Inc. has been installed at the plant to trap CO2 produced from the industrial processes. The technology enables the cement facility to capture the CO2 contained in the cement flue gas and to reuse it for CO2-cured concrete, thus storing it permanently.
Svante offers companies in emissions-intensive industries a commercially viable way to capture large-scale CO2 emissions from existing infrastructure, either for safe storage or to be recycled for further industrial use in a closed-loop. Total, a company committed to cleaner and innovative energy, is also involved in the project.
Coupling the Svante equipment with alternative fuels used at the plant creates the world’s first full-cycle solution to capture and reuse CO2 from a cement plant and lead the way to a near-zero emissions cement facility.
“Lafarge sees tremendous value in partnering with clean technology companies to solve the challenges of today for a better tomorrow,” says Cailee Ellis, head of sustainability and environment – Western Canada for Lafarge Canada Inc. “Our partnership with Svante has been critical in achieving our carbon capture, utilization and storage goals at Richmond and supporting Holcim on its path to net-zero.
“At Lafarge, climate and energy is one of our primary sustainability pillars. We are already applying the learning from the pilot and de-risking of Svante’s technologies at other Lafarge assets to advance our net-zero goals.”
Flue gas from the plant’s manufacturing facility is now captured through Svante’s equipment – reducing the amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere. The system purifies the cement flue gas by trapping its contaminants to enable an efficient and durable CO2 capture process. The next step is to figure out ways to use the captured CO2 such as reinjecting it into low-carbon fuels, concrete and fly ash.
That work is slated to take place over the next three years and will include the installation of a liquefaction unit and the development of an expansion project to further reduce emissions.
The process has not been implemented in a cement plant anywhere else in the world. The success of the Lafarge project could cause a major shift in the manufacturing of cement in Canada and around the world.
Phase one of the multi-phase project has been completed and entailed pre-treating the flue gas, making it suitable for Svante’s carbon capture technology.
The project is now in phase two, which entails separating the CO2 from the flue gas through Svante’s carbon capture technology.
As the project advances to phase three, Lafarge is working with Svante to identify feasible uses for the captured CO2 and consider liquefaction of the CO2. The third phase is scheduled for the next three years and will include the installation of a unit to liquefy the gas and the development of an expansion project to further reduce emissions, as well as putting together a business case for further expansion across the Lafarge network.
Project CO2MENT provides an opportunity to evaluate the potential for a new business model for supplying industrial post-combustion CO2 to the existing CO2 market as well as assessing the economic feasibility of newly developed CO2-use technologies.
Ellis says that having Svante on the site has increased efficiency of the technology and created co-benefits for respective teams to learn more about each other’s processes and the benefits of the technology.
“Having the technology on-site ensures that we are learning together. Government funding and the role of public investment has been a tremendous support in advancing investment into this project and ultimately the technology.”
Brad Kohl, president and CEO of Lafarge Western Canada, said in a statement that it’s been a turbulent year for business and people due to the COVID-19 pandemic. with many large-scale projects being put on hold, but the perseverance of people working at the Richmond Cement plant is evident in the success of the project.
“To continue leading change in the building materials industry means we are always looking to partner with like-minded thought leaders such as Svante and Total. This partnership is showcasing our drive towards a net-zero future, and we are seeing this vision become a reality, right now with the completion of this phase.”
Claude Letourneau, president and CEO of Svante, said there has been work on energy efficiencies and renewables, but no major developments on capturing and cost-effectively using CO₂ emissions from industrial sources, until now.
“The last piece of this problem is essential because it is the part that allows us to transition to a carbon-neutral marketplace. Our partnership with Lafarge is building a new net-zero economy, and that is a very positive message we are sending to the world – it can be done.”
Fully on board with aspirations. Wishing for success. I am curious how the business case could be made without knowing the end market uses precisely enough to evaluate cost and income derived from marketing Co2.","This partnership is showcasing our drive towards a net-zero future, and we are seeing this vision become a reality, right now with the completion of this phase.”

- The Industrial Deep Decarbonisation Initiative (IDDI) is setting the standards for green building products and ways to track embodied carbon.
- More governments need to make 2030 commitments for greener steel and concrete now, so that these products become the norm by mid-century, writes an expert.
This article was originally published on the International Institute for Sustainable Development’s SDG Knowledge Hub.
Stalled steel and cement plants in Europe and India, monster blackouts slowing factories in China, Germany’s deadly floods, Madagascar’s drought – If 2020 was the year of an unexpected pandemic, 2021 will be the year of two unprecedented but expected crises. The energy and climate crises, two sides of the same coin. It’s time to stop the dangerous growth of green-house gas emissions, by decoupling industrial development from climate-polluting energy use. And, we have the levers to do it. We need governments to step up now, starting with steel and concrete.
Steel and concrete are the fabric of our modern societies. They make our homes, cars, roads, hospitals, schools and appliances. Their use is also booming as urbanization and industrialization gain pace across the global south. The world is expected to build the equivalent of another New York City every month for the next 40 years. Globally, we are already adding the entire built area of Japan, annually. Steel and concrete are responsible for 14–16 per cent of global energy-related CO2 emissions. Changing the way our societies’ build will require revolutionizing these industries’ core processes. This massive task must be tackled if our global community is to meet the climate-safe targets agreed in 2015 – but the pathway is clear.
Have you read?
The good news, and an action that can be a game-changer, is that we can affordably decarbonise steel and concrete production by mid-century, if we start now. Industry leaders have already begun. They know that the risk of climate-related assets becoming stranded is too high and costly. To safeguard their future prosperity, cement and steel makers, such as Holcim, thyssenkrupp and HeidelbergCement, have made commitments to net-zero production targets and are researching promising technologies, such as replacing fossil fuels with green hydrogen. The finance sector is also making important moves. Earlier this year, six global banks agreed to develop a climate-aligned finance agreement to support decarbonization of the steel sector.
Governments now need to take urgent action to make greener steel and concrete commercially viable. Accelerating the transformation of these industries is the way to build back better. A group of countries, together with the UN Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), are taking the lead through the Industrial Deep Decarbonisation Initiative (IDDI). The United Kingdom, India, Germany, Canada, the United Arab Emirates as well as industry and non-government partners are setting the standards for green building products and establishing ways to track their embodied carbon. This is an essential and significant first step.
What's the World Economic Forum doing to tackle air pollution?
Over 50% of countries have established national ambient air quality standards, but we must do more to protect citizens and our planet.
During COP26 the World Economic Forum and the Clean Air Fund launched the first global private sector initiative to tackle air pollution.
Founding members of the Alliance for Clean Air are committed to measuring and decreasing their air pollution emissions, creating healthier communities around the world.
Members of the Alliance for Clean Air will:
- Establish air pollution footprints on nitrogen oxides, sulphur oxides, particulate matter within 12 months
- Pinpoint where they are being emitted to track human exposure
- Set ambitious targets and objectives to reduce the air pollution emissions, with a clear action plan
- Act as champions for clean air by raising awareness among employees, customers and communities about the impact of air pollution. They will also help them to reduce their exposure and support them to take action to reduce pollution
- Use their assets innovatively to accelerate clean air solutions
Also at COP26, a practical guide for businesses on how to measure air pollution across value chains is being introduced by the Climate and Clean Air Coalition and Stockholm Environment Institute, in co-operation with IKEA. The guide will support companies to understand their impact on air quality and to take necessary actions to reduce their emissions.
If your company is committed to improving air quality contact us to express interest in working with us.
IDDI partners also want to use green public procurement to create markets for low-carbon steel and concrete. Governments buy 40 per cent of the cement and 25 per cent of the steel sold in their domestic markets. By pledging to purchase significant amounts of low-carbon steel and concrete, governments are sending strong signals to industries that “if you make it, we’ll buy it”, hence triggering the needed investments for production scale- up.
More governments need to take the lead by making 2030 commitments for greener steel and concrete now, so that these products become the norm by mid-century. At the recent G20 Summit, leaders reinforced their commitments to limit global warming and take further action to limit GHG emissions. The pivotal UN Climate Change conference COP26, ongoing in Glasgow, presents a unique chance for governments to show leadership and accelerate the transformation towards green steel and concrete, securing a safe and prosperous future for everyone.","Members of the Alliance for Clean Air will:

https://www.worldcement.com/europe-cis/23112021/holcim-supports-first-exhibition-on-history-of-concrete-in-switzerland/,"Tue, 23 Nov 2021 08:00:00 GMT",Holcim supports first exhibition on history of concrete in Switzerland - World Cement,"Holcim is proudly supporting Beton, the first Swiss exhibition dedicated to the history of concrete, which has recently opened at the S AM Swiss Architecture Museum in Basel and is on display until 24 April 2022. From the Pantheon in Rome – the world’s largest unreinforced concrete dome – to the Burj Khalifa in Dubai – the tallest building on earth – concrete has been shaping the world we live in for centuries. Beton explores the history of concrete, the world’s most used material after water, showcasing for the first time original drawings, models and photographs from Switzerland’s leading architecture archives.
Jan Jenisch, CEO Holcim: “I congratulate our partners at the S AM Swiss Architecture Museum for creating this first of its kind exhibition showcasing the essential role of concrete in our world. This exploration is a great inspiration for all of us at Holcim as we shape the future of concrete, making it green, circular and technology-driven. Throughout its history, concrete has been part of building progress in our world. Today we are reinventing it to make it work for people and the planet.”
Partnering with S AM Swiss Architecture Museum to host a series of events with architects and construction experts, Holcim will participate in the conference ‘The future of concrete’ on 27 January 2022. Holcim experts will discuss how the company is establishing a new language for concrete that is green, circular and technology-driven, as recently shared in the Striatus project (https://www.holcim.com/striatus-bridge), featured in Venice at the occasion of this year’s architectural Biennale.
Establishing a new language for concrete
Holcim is reinventing concrete, making it green, circular and technology-driven, to build a net-zero future. Last year, it launched the world’s first global range of green concrete ECOPact, offering from 30% to 100% reduced CO2 footprint. Already present in 24 markets, ECOPact is making low carbon construction possible at scale around the world.
Enabling smart design to build more with less, Holcim is deploying technologies like 3D printing using 70% less concrete with no compromise on performance. Holcim is also a world leader in recycling, driving the circular economy, on its way to using 100 million t of recycled materials across its business by 2030. As an example, Holcim launched the world’s first green cement in Switzerland with 20% recycled construction & demolition waste inside.
Partnering for more impact, Holcim joined the First Movers Coalition (FMC) at COP 26 in Glasgow, as a founding member alongside companies from Apple to Volvo to drive more green demand across their supply chains. Putting science to work, Holcim has been a founding supporter of ETH’s Chair for Sustainable Architecture for close to a decade, as well as a founding member of MIT’s Climate and Sustainability Consortium.

https://www.globalcement.com/news/item/13454-goodbye-to-2021,"Wed, 22 Dec 2021 08:00:00 GMT",Goodbye to 2021 - Cement industry news from Global Cement - Global Cement,"Two stories tie into larger trends this week as Global Cement Weekly says goodbye to 2021. Firstly, the state government of Odisha dropped a bombshell this week with its approval for an 18.75Mt/yr cement plant. Keen readers of the Global Cement Directory should note that, if built, this would be around the 10th largest plant worldwide and possibly the biggest outside of China. Credit to Odisha and India though for showing us how to end the year!
Odisha has been encouraging steel production in recent years. In March 2021 local press reported that Arcelor Mittal Nippon Steel (AMNS) had signed a memorandum of understanding with the state government for a US$6.6bn steel plant in the same district. Notably, a more binding agreement was intended to be signed once land and mining leases had been secured. This week the state said that its High Level Clearance Authority had approved an enlarged plan with AMNS worth US$13.5bn. This includes a 24Mt/yr steel plant and a 18.75Mt/yr cement plant. Both are to be built in phases over seven years. No further word on those land and mining leases though. How this fits into India’s overall plans for net zero CO2 emissions by 2070 is anyone’s guess. Yet this is another cement project linked to steel production. Readers may recall that steel producer Companhia Siderúrgica Nacional (CSN) Cimentos picked up Holcim’s Brazilian cement plants in September 2021.
The other story of note this week was Cembureau’s calculation that if the European Union (EU) emissions trading scheme (ETS) CO2 price reached Euro90/t then this could represent up to 15% of a cement plant’s production costs. The European cement association made the calculation using data from Ecorys, WIFO, the National Institute of Economic and Social Research for the EU Commission and Agora Energiewende. It wants the EU to bolster carbon leakage measures as soon as possible to fight rising import rates from outside the region. It is pushing for a delay to phasing out the free allocation in the ETS, bringing forward the proposed carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM) and for legislators to tackle rising carbon and energy costs generally. It should be noted that the EU ETS price reached Euro88/t on 8 December 2021 but it has stayed below that level since then.
As mentioned at the start, both of the stories above connect to larger trends, principally the cement sector’s adjustments to meet its sustainability goals. A new cement plant with a readily available supply of ground granulated blast furnace slag, such as a potential AMNS unit might have, can reduce its clinker factor more easily than its competitors. One major story in Europe over the last two years has been the steep increase in the ETS price, and Cembureau is highlighting the problems this has caused its members. Global Cement Magazine has run a number of annual round-ups in the last two issues that cover these issues and others. Dr Robert McCaffrey’s news and trends list for 2021 from the Global Cement LIVE broadcast on 21 December 2021 pulls together many of these ideas and more and is well worth watching.
We’ll finish with a list of the top 10 news stories on the Global Cement website in 2021. This reflects what readers all over the world are interested in at a particular time and the list is also biased towards stories that were published in the first half of the year as they have had more time to gather views. Yet, note, new plants in Africa and South Asia, a cement shortage story, Holcim’s decision to change its name and the problems a European producer, Cementa, has had with its quarrying. All of these touch upon larger themes.

https://canada.constructconnect.com/joc/news/associations/2021/08/cement-producers-scrambling-to-cut-carbon-emissions,"Fri, 06 Aug 2021 07:00:00 GMT",Cement producers scrambling to cut carbon emissions - constructconnect.com - Daily Commercial News,"Canadian cement producers are scrambling to find means of cutting CO2 emissions on all fronts as the federal government clamps down on emitters and has given notice that low-carbon concrete will be integral to future building contracts as part of its climate change strategy.
The cement industry is tagged as contributing seven to eight per cent of global CO2 emissions. “Government is the largest purchaser of concrete and can incorporate the CO2 emissions of concrete products in its procurement process in addition to traditional factors like bid, cost and performance. The Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat would be encouraged to consider concrete as an initial sector to pilot its Greening Government Strategy,” said a release announcing an industry and private sector working group.
The group, led by the Cement Association of Canada, the National Research Council and the Standards Council of Canada, in collaboration with Innovation, Science and Economic Development, has until December 2021 to roadmap a path to Canadian leadership in low CO2 emission concrete use.
Canada’s move aligns with the U.S. where states have adopted bills to use low-emission concrete and Europe’s toughened stance on emitters, prompting companies such as HeidelbergCement to announce the building of net-zero plant.
“We are seeing innovation in the industry such as we have not seen before,” said Jeff Sieg, communications director for Lehigh Hanson.
His company, a North American subsidiary of HeidelbergCement, is working on all fronts, alternative fuels, new low-carbon products and carbon capture, store and use strategies, to reduce its CO2 footprint.
“Our competitors are also doing different things,” said Sieg, adding this will benefit the industry as more options will speed up change. “It is a transition time for the industry.”
Sieg said Lehigh Hanson cement plants in the U.S. and Canada are exploring alternative fuels such as biofuels, natural and tires. Its three Canadian cement plants, Delta, Edmonton and Picton, are producing EcoCem and EcoCem Plus, which replaces a portion of the Portland cement clinker with ground limestone. EcoCem Plus, which also uses flyash, can reduce the carbon footprint by as much as 22 per cent.
At the Edmonton cement plant, Lehigh Hanson is also working on a pilot project that will capture CO2 from flue gases. The project is still in its feasibility stage, said Sieg, with the company looking at uses for the captured CO2 such as in concrete production.
The Lehigh feasibility study looks at the viability of capturing 90 to 95 per cent of the CO2 – an estimated 600,000 tonnes annually. The Edmonton project is a partnership with the International CCS Knowledge Centre and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Group.
Lafarge is also exploring new options. This spring the company launched its low-carbon cement EcoPlanet, which decreased its manufacturing CO2 emissions by 35 per cent and follows on EcoPact concrete’s release last year.
In Seattle, Wash. an optimized mix of EcoPlanet cement and slag reduced emissions even further.
“The emissions were reduced by 62 per cent,” said Rene Thibault, Lafarge Holcim’s head of North America.
Lafarge also has a carbon capture and use pilot project CO2MENT with technology company Svante in place at its Richmond, B.C. cement plant. It is nearing its third phase after launching in 2019.
The first phase involved pre-treating flue gas for Svante’s carbon capture technology.
“Currently, we are in stage two, where the CO2 is separated from the flue gas through Svante’s carbon capture technology. As we advance to phase three, Lafarge is working with Svante to identify feasible utilization opportunities for the captured CO2 and considering liquefaction of the CO2,” said Jill Truscott, Lafarge’s Western Canada communications manager.
Phase three, which involves the utilization and possible liquefaction, is likely by end of 2022. “Liquefaction is not mandatory for some of the utilization options being considered, however, it is an option should it be required for utilization,” she said.
In early July, Svante received a $25 million federal government boost, which allows the company to set-up a new Centre of Excellence for Carbon Capture Use and Storage in Burnaby, B.C. and to scale up its manufacturing operations to produce commercial scale structured absorbent filters and to test its proprietary rapid adsorption machine designs.
Lafarge has also signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Calgary-based Carbon Upcycling Technologies.
The MOU allows for the potential integration of Carbon Upcycling’s CO2-embedded concrete additive into Lafarge operations, while exploring opportunities to expand Carbon Upcycling’s operating capacity by developing larger processing facilities.
Carbon Upcycling produces carbon treated concrete additives such as its treated flyash, landfill ash, steel slag, crushed glass and other materials that increases the concrete strength but reduces the amount of cement required and can reduce concrete’s footprint by 25 per cent over the lifecycle.
“We are into carbon utilization by trade,” said Ryan Bourns, strategy and business development lead for Carbon Upcycling.
Currently, the business is capturing CO2 from flue gases at a Calgary natural gas power plant and placing the gas into a pressurized reactor along with materials. The tumbled material captures the carbon and becomes a carrier taking it forward into concrete ready mix production.
As well as working with Lafarge, “we are also supplying BURNCO with flyash,” Bourns said, as the company produces and sells its own enhanced flyash.
It has also formed a strategic relationship with Mexico’s Cemex, although it has yet to work in the country. The multi-national company is interested in the ability to use substitute materials that will reduce the cement content but still provide concrete strength.
Bourns said the company wants to move forward and develop a 200-ton-per-day facility and also locate a string of capture and utilize facilities in areas where there is opportunity to distribute material to the surrounding ready mix concrete suppliers.
BURNCO is one of more than 300 worldwide concrete producers that use the CarbonCure technology, developed by a Canadian company.
Bourns said he is encouraged by industry and government in its recent bid to decarbonize the industry.
“This is going to have a trickledown effect on every project whether there is government or private funding,” he said.

Hello from Vallejo, California a working class town on the far edge of the San Francisco Bay where citizens stopped a so-called “green” cement factory from being built on our waterfront. The proposed company’s own documents revealed that 16 tons of toxic dust a year would have escaped into the nearby neighborhood from the loading and movement of the materials stored outside the plant. It was the stored materials—not the smokestack—that put the residents in harm’s way.","As we advance to phase three, Lafarge is working with Svante to identify feasible utilization opportunities for the captured CO2 and considering liquefaction of the CO2,” said Jill Truscott, Lafarge’s Western Canada communications manager. In early July, Svante received a $25 million federal government boost, which allows the company to set-up a new Centre of Excellence for Carbon Capture Use and Storage in Burnaby, B.C. Canadian cement producers are scrambling to find means of cutting CO2 emissions on all fronts as the federal government clamps down on emitters and has given notice that low-carbon concrete will be integral to future building contracts as part of its climate change strategy."

The parent company LafargeHolcim Ltd had previously acquired a stake in the Swiss start-up CPC AG.
The aim of the cooperation is to produce high-performance thin concrete slabs with a high-strength concrete for the German, Dutch and Scandinavian markets on a larger scale in Vetra's precast concrete plants from autumn 2021. The CPC concrete elements are reinforced exclusively with pre-stressed carbon fibres. Customers receive needs-based cuts of the elements, logistics services and support in the use of innovative connection technologies.
CPC AG will supply the technology and the carbon fibres. For the production of these special carbon fibres, CPC AG will build a new plant in Switzerland. Holcim Germany and Vetra will set up the world's first major production facility and further optimise the components in terms of design (e.g. via concrete technology and composition). The general building inspectorate approval from the German Institute for Structural Engineering DIBt is to be granted in 2021. With this approval, the CPC panels can be statically dimensioned for many applications. Compared to conventional reinforced concrete elements, the required amount of concrete can be reduced by up to 75% with the same load utilisation. The smaller amount of concrete massively reduces the dead weight of the structure, lowers the CO2 footprint and the transport costs are also reduced significantly. Another CO2 reduction of the component results from the use of significantly smaller amounts of carbon instead of large amounts of steel (factor 30). The thin elements can be manufactured industrially and in large formats and then cut to size – similar to large-format panels in wood or steel construction. In addition to simple, free-form cuts, surface treatments such as milling and brushing, drilling, slot milling or pockets are possible.
“In the course of 2021, the necessary renovation work will initially take place in the Vetra precast concrete plant in Essen near Oldenburg in Lower Saxony. Production of the new elements is planned to start in autumn 2021. For these innovative concrete elements, a wide range of possible uses opens up in the construction sector – for example for filigree and sustainably produced balcony slabs, stairs, bridges and freely designed facade elements. This will also be of interest to many planners and architects who are looking for new, more sustainable solutions for their customers” explains Stefan Gramberg, Managing Director of Vetra Beton Fertigteilwerke GmbH.“With Holcim EcoPact Zero, we have already introduced the first CO2-neutral concrete in Germany. This cooperation in the field of precast elements is another important milestone in our growth strategy and at the same time makes a clear contribution to achieving our sustainability goals. I am very much looking forward to working with CPC AG in the future. Our strengths complement each other very well and together we drive innovations for more sustainable construction. Our customers in the precast sector will thus achieve both economic and ecological advantages. Holcim is thus offering another innovative, CO2-reduced and at the same time resource-saving product that significantly improves the CO2 balance of buildings,” Thorsten Hahn, Chairman of the Management Board of Holcim (Deutschland) GmbH, adds.
“We want to continue growing together – with this new construction idea for concrete with an unbelievably wide range of applications. The exclusive cooperation with the Holcim Deutschland Group now enables us to further optimise the idea, implement necessary investments and penetrate a significantly larger market with the innovative thin concrete elements”, says Prof. Josef Kurath, member of the board of directors of CPC AG and developer of the same new production methods and the associated innovative connection technologies.

A housing project in Melbourne’s inner north which incorporates concrete that cuts embodied carbon by as much as half has won $54 million in funding from the federal government’s green finance fund.
With 74 townhouses planned, the Northcote Place development is aiming high in the sustainability stakes, targeting an 8-star rating under the Nationwide House Energy Rating Scheme (NatHERS). Such a rating was achieved by less than 2 per cent of new homes built over 2020.
To achieve that rating, the Metro development on Beavers Road in Northcote, overlooking the Merri Creek, has assembled an array of high-tech features including all-electric induction cooking, heat pump hot
water, and rooftop solar systems with the option to add battery storage and wiring to be electric vehicle ready. It will have rainwater tanks connected to both toilets and laundries.
Beneath all of that, the homes are built from a low carbon concrete, Holcim ECOPact, that reduces embodied carbon by 30 per cent to 60 per cent.
While the Clean Energy Finance Corporation regularly directs investment into the housing sector, it is the first time it has financed a residential housing project aiming to achieve the 8-star rating.
“Australia’s residential sector has an important role to play in decarbonising our economy,” said CEFC chief executive Ian Learmonth. “Northcote Place demonstrates that a high standard of housing development is readily achievable and with advances in technology we now have even more opportunities to make our homes greener.”
“This project marks the first financing by the CEFC for a housing development featuring this type of low-carbon concrete. By working with developers such as Metro, we hope to see these features become standard practice in new home development, to accelerate Australia’s transition to a low carbon economy.”
The average home at the Northcote development will use an estimated 50 per cent less energy than a new home built to minimum building code requirements. All homes will also include a minimum three-kilowatt rooftop solar panel system, saving as much as $200 in energy costs per billing cycle.
Metro managing director Luke Hartman said that energy-efficient housing was attracting an increasing number of owner-occupiers.
“Interest in environmentally conscious housing is growing, and we have seen strong demand for these homes,” he said. “We expect to see appetite for homes that have similar emissions-reducing features increase in the future.”
The CEFC is already a big investor in property, with exposure across the commercial real estate sector such as its $80 million equity investment into QIC’s Shopping Centre Fund and a $50 million stake in a hotel development fund run by Pro-invest.
It has also been stepping up its exposure to the residential sector, such as by financing discount green home loans to increase construction of energy-efficient homes. Earlier this year, the CEFC provided a $75 million loan to ASX-listed budget accommodation provider Ingenia to boost its carbon reduction and energy initiatives.
The CEFC has also injected $125 million in seed capital into a Qualitas-run debt fund that will back an ambitious plan for $1 billion in build-to-rent housing.

Concrete has a carbon problem and industry, academia and government will need to pull out all the stops to trim its footprint.
It’s difficult to imagine a world without concrete. After water, it’s the second most consumed material in the world and it’s everywhere – in our buildings, footpaths and roads. The substance is synonymous with the modern world and while it can, at times, feel grey and monotonous, it’s also incredibly flexible and can be moulded into architectural masterpieces.
But concrete has a carbon problem. Cement, concrete’s key ingredient that binds the other sand and gravel together to give it its famed strength, is the source of about 8 per cent of the world’s carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions.
Cutting the emissions in cement is hard because the emissions largely come from an unavoidable chemical reaction during its manufacture. Swapping out cement for other low carbon binding ingredients is an option but despite years of experimentation, no alternative has been found that can completely replace cement without sacrificing performance.
The material’s carbon footprint is being taken seriously. This year, the Global Cement and Concrete Association launched a roadmap to decarbonise the global industry by 2050, and closer to home, Cement, Concrete and Aggregates Australia (CCAA) and other organisations have commissioned a report on decarbonisation pathways for Australia’s concrete and cement industry.
It’s evident that all levers will need to be pulled to meet this target and even then, the industry is pinning its hopes on expensive, unproven carbon capture utilisation and storage (CCUS) technologies to squeeze emissions out of its supply chain entirely.
Materials expert Jonas Bengtsson, chief executive officer and co-founder of sustainability consultancy Edge, confirms that there’s been no real “breakthroughs” in low carbon concrete technology and that the task at hand relies on incremental change.
“We’re kind of a little bit locked in, because I don’t think we can do much without concrete. Demand is just increasing. We can’t just miniaturise the built environment,” Bengtsson says.
“So at this stage it is about looking at what are the options to minimise the impact.”
Bengtsson says there’s “a lot of healthy competition” between concrete manufacturers to lower the per cubic metre carbon intensity of the product.
But he says the concrete industry is not the only actor that can help drive down the emission profile of the sector. For a start, many emissions occur further up the supply chain in the clinker production, which may not necessarily be in the concrete manufacturer’s purview. And further down the supply chain, builders are also responsible for a lot of spillage and wastage of the grey mixture.
The design and engineering profession also have a role to play to specify less concrete in buildings and infrastructure and, better yet, developers should consider the lifespan of structures and design them in a way that they can be adapted for reuse in the future.
By way of example, Bengtsson says car parks can be designed with higher ceilings in the expectation that in a few decades, they can be easily converted into office space or apartments rather than being demolished.
“We’re just going to be in that cycle where we need more and more concrete forever unless we build a bit smarter for adaptive reuse.”
“I don’t think, these days, we can have a conversation with a client, a developer, without carbon coming into the conversation.”
Using lower carbon materials will also play a role, as will hybrid structures where the strength and performance of materials such as concrete and steel are paired with lower carbon materials such as timber.
George Agriogiannis, chief executive officer at Holcim Australia, which has a Science based Target and is offering a carbon neutral concrete product (achieved via offsets), says there’s a lot of demand in the market for lower carbon materials.
“I don’t think, these days, we can have a conversation with a client, a developer, without carbon coming into the conversation.”
A very stubborn source of emissions
There are two big ticket emissions-intensive processes in cement manufacturing. The first is the use of fossil fuels in heat processing, which is responsible for about 40-45 per cent of emissions, and the second is an unavoidable chemical reaction called calcination that is responsible for around 50 per cent of emissions where calcium carbonate turns into lime and carbon dioxide.
[diagram from CCAA’s report https://cement.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Decarbonisation_Pathways_Australian_Cement_and_Concrete_Sector.pdf]
Cement Concrete & Aggregates Australia chief executive officer Ken Slattery says so far the industry has focused on reducing emissions during processing using alternative fuels, new kiln technologies that use less fuel, and improved grinding and processing activities.
He says the industry has already travelled a reasonable distance towards decarbonisation, achieving around 25 per cent reduction in emissions since 2000.
“But the opportunities for further reduction are getting harder and harder.”
With the low hanging fruit already picked, the industry is now focused on clinker emissions. Slattery says the only way to reduce clinker emissions is to avoid using as much of it and to supplement it with other materials.
The practice of substituting clinker for what are known as supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) is now fairly common.
By adding fly ash (a bi-product from burning coal) and ground granulated blast furnace slag (a bi-product from steelmaking), concrete manufacturers have been able to lower the emissions content of their products without detracting from performance. In fact, the substitutions can sometimes improve concrete properties.
Why a low carbon cement substitute is so elusive
According to Dr Louise Keyte, Boral general manager – technology execution and co-director of the UTS Boral Centre for Sustainable Building, the primary limitation of cement replacements is around strength development.
Concrete is not a one-size-fits-all product. Different mixes have different properties. For example, for the concrete floors in a multistorey building, rapid strength development is important to keep construction tracking on schedule.
The problem is that when cement is replaced by SCMs, they react more slowly than and take longer to contribute to strength development.
Keyte explains that this delay presents challenges for tight construction timelines and budgets. Waiting an extra day for a slab to harden enough for the next phase of construction can quickly blow out costs when 20 contractors have to wait around for those extra days.
“That’s why innovation is critical, we want to be able to provide a lower carbon option without that compromise.”
The company already has a range of low carbon concrete options, each suited to different applications, which are able to achieve as high as a 50 per cent reduction in cement. Keyte says one of her research priorities is to improve on this score and whittle cement content down by 70 per cent.
Inflexible specifications and regulations stopping innovation in low carbon concrete
Slattery says there’s still more opportunities to reduce emissions through SCMs but there are some barriers.
Top of the list is overhauling Australia’s restrictive standards and specifications for concrete. Designed to ensure fit-for-purpose concrete ends up in roads, buildings and other critical infrastructure.
Holcim Australia’s Agriogiannis says that the industry tends to be very risk averse and defaults to specifications used in past projects.
To encourage low emissions innovations, the industry is calling for specifications that are performance-based.
“So there’s a big body of work that’s required to facilitate that,” Slattery says.
He says governments, state governments in particular, could unlock innovation in this area by taking on more of the risk. When around 15-20 per cent of concrete goes into major government infrastructure projects, he says governments could really help drive change in the industry through overarching procurement policies that preference low carbon materials.
“And we’ve seen that change around the world. So it’s not impossible.”
What about when fly ash and slag run out?
Another distant problem on the horizon is that common cement replacement materials are actually bi-products from other carbon intensive processes – burning coal and making steel in a blast iron furnace – that also need to be phased out as part of the decarbonisation challenge. There’s currently an abundance of fly ash around but alternatives will need to be sourced in the future.
Slattery says there are some “fairly encouraging developments” around the natural materials rather than recycled materials that are very low carbon emissions. Geopolymers are one such alternative, although Slattery says geopolymers will only work in some situations.
Competition for diminishing supplies of fly ash could also increase as Bengtsson says there are other uses for it, such as in ceramic tiles, plaster and in paints and adhesives.
Carbon capture and storage
At this point in time, carbon capture utilisation and storage technologies are set to play a pivotal role in decarbonising concrete.
Commercialising this technology has so far faced substantial barriers but unlike in the energy generation space where renewables can replace fossil fuels, Bengtsson says at this stage there are no real alternatives to CCUS to remove the stubborn emissions emitted during clinker calcination.
“CCUS is where a lot of the faith is.”
Bengtsson is apprehensive about relying so heavily on CCUS technology but recognises that there aren’t many credible alternatives to Portland cement. Even the low carbon attributes of geopolymer cement aren’t as promising as first thought and he says rigorous studies are showing the product to be only slightly better than a heavily optimised Portland cement (made with fly ash etc).
“It’s not a zero emissions alternative technology, far from it.”
This technology is still a long way from broad adoption. Global materials manufacturer HeidelbergCement is, however, upgrading its cement plant in the Swedish Islands to capture CO2 and then transport it for permanent storage site offshore several kilometres down in bedrock. The plant is expected to be the first carbon neutral cement plant, and is expected to be fully carbon neutral by 2030.
“That will really start to demonstrate what the options are for the industry.”
Agriogiannis says it’s still very early days with this technology.
“At the moment, we don’t have a lot of data to support how successful it’s going to be or how expensive it’s going to be.”
“What we do know, though, is that for Australia, about a third of carbon emitted will have to be captured.”
He says the R&D and commercialisation of this technology isn’t going to come cheap and will be an area that the industry will be seeking government support for.
Putting carbon to good use
There are also companies turning the low carbon challenge on its head.
Canadian based company CarbonCure Technologies, which is currently eyeing off the Australian market, is in the business of treating carbon as a resource rather than a nuisance waste product.
Senior director of sustainability for CarbonCure Technologies, Christie Gamble, says the company’s commercial technology, already used in North America and other parts of the globe, works by introducing carbon dioxide that’s been captured from an industrial source, typically an ethanol plant or fertiliser plant, depending on local conditions, into concrete as it’s being mixed.
When this precise dose of liquified and purified CO2 is injected into the mixing concrete, a chemical reaction occurs where the CO2 reacts with other materials in the cement to convert into a calcium carbonate mineral. Within a couple of minutes, Gamble says the CO2 becomes permanently embedded in the concrete.
The technology has the advantage of improving the concrete’s strength, which allows the use of less cement. Using less cement means lower carbon concrete, and also lower costs because cement is the most expensive ingredient in concrete.
“So it creates a financial model that works for the concrete producer to be able to decarbonise because they’re able to reduce some of their material costs.”
The technology is no silver bullet but does deliver a 5 per cent reduction in global warming potential compared to traditional carbon. Gamble also says that the technology is compatible with other decarbonising strategies, such as substituting for cement, and that the company has other technologies and innovations in R&D that will push the carbon footprint reduction even further.
The technology does have the benefit of locking away carbon that would otherwise be used in beverages or other uses that will be eventually released into the atmosphere.
“And that’s where CO2 utilisation solutions like Carbon Cure are so critical, it creates a demand for more capture of CO2.”
In terms of retrofitting the technology, it’s a fairly straightforward task of installing a tank filled with liquefied CO2. The concrete producer incurs the costs but these are offset by the material cost savings that comes from using less cement.
“In most scenarios, it’s price neutral.”
Fuels also matter
Bengtsson says that the industry has been slow to adopt lower carbon fuel sources such as waste-to-energy and biomass.
“It’s still largely based on fossil fuel based energy, which is an opportunity.”
The industry would also like to see regulatory changes to allow the use of biomass in kilns to replace fossil fuels.
Slattery says anything with calorific value is attractive, such as waste timber, sewage sludge and tyres. Take up of these waste products is “accelerating fairly quickly” but Slattery says there are some limitations to tapping into the biomass resource, including government regulations.
Closing the loop
From a circular economy perspective, one of the key benefits of concrete is that a building, designed well, will last a long time. Concrete buildings and infrastructure can also be demolished, recycled and sold back as concrete or road base.
Dwindling sand supplies have been identified as an issue for the industry, with concerns raised about ecological damage to beaches and river beds as well as links to criminal activity to mine the finite material.
There are ways to avoid using natural sand by using aggregate crushed into a substance resembling sand. Boral’s Envirocrete, for example, claims to use a “manufactured” sand made from aggregate.
There’s also a lot of innovation underway to replace raw materials with recycled alternatives.
Civil Engineering expert and Associate Professor at Macquarie University Sorn Vimonsatit and her colleagues at Macquarie University, which is hosting the SmartCrete CRC, have secured $400,000 to develop a polymer concrete using waste latex paint.
Along with reducing raw resource use in concrete manufacturing, Vimonsatit also says the circular economy creates new employment opportunities, which is a social sustainability benefit that shouldn’t be overlooked.
Trucking this heavy material around is also emission intensive
Transport is another carbon intensive component of the concrete supply chain. Slattery says it’s responsible for around 10-15 per cent of the industry’s carbon footprint and given the weight of the material, decarbonising land transport is not as simple as electrifying fleets. Slattery says this area will need “quite a lot of investment” and flags hydrogen power trucks as an option.
Carbon offtake – how significant is this really?
Holcim Australia’s head of sustainability Cyril Giraud says that concrete also offtakes carbon where, through the life of the concrete, carbon is reabsorbed into the material.
He says the industry is trying to get the embodied carbon reducing capabilities of this phenomenon recognised.
When questioned on the expected effectiveness of carbon offtakes, it could account for around 6 per cent of the total decarbonisation challenge. “So that’s definitely significant.”
From the lab to real world application
The challenged material has attracted Cooperative Research Centres (CRC) funding, which are grants for medium to long-term, industry-led research collaborations. Sustainability is part of the mandate for the SmartCrete CRC along with improving productivity in concrete construction and maintenance of concrete assets.
Vimonsatit, who is involved in SmartCrete CRC research, says that it’s important for industry, academia and government to work collaboratively to solve the decarbonisation and sustainability challenges facing concrete, and that the industry should default to sharing sustainability knowledge.
She also says that for the government to be recognised as a world leader, Australia will need a clear national roadmap to govern the industry sectors.
“And we need to see a strong commitment by the government leadership to provide the necessary resources in the form of funding.”
The appetite for sand in concrete manufacture is extremely damaging to ecosystems from which it is extracted and needs to be accounted both in emissions and sustainability terms.
This is a good article covering most of the bases, but perhaps we have to accept that this is an intractable problem.
Concrete is so ubiquitous that its hard to see it being replaced, but where we can use timber structures we should. PFA is going to dissappear as we transition fully to renewable energy (which doesn’t burn coal), steel slag will remain, even if steel is produced from biochar or hydrogen, but you cannot hide from chemistry. Whether the emissions happen on and are attributed to the steel producer or at the cement works making clinker, in both cases limestone carbonates are calcined to release CO2 – it is unavoidable. The only alternative is to substitute naturally alkaline minerals (where the calcination happened in the past from volcanic activity).
AND here’s the kicker, concrete per tonne is STILL a relatively low impact material compared to most alternatives (except timber), but we use a hell of a lot of it. That’s why noone has come up with a miracle solution – concrete already has lower impacts than alternatives.
CCS is an absurd idea for concrete, since you would need a vast amount of energy to make it work – that energy would HAVE to be decarbonised renewable energy, but we MUST decarbonise the grid before we attempt to decarbonise concrete. AND I think that there’s a better way – don’t try – instead mine alkaline basalt and seed the oceans with it. The oceans contain 17 times more CO2 than the atmosphere. Basalt seeding would raise ocean pH helping to protect coral and crustaceans from ocean acidification, precipitate carbonates to the ocean floor, permanently locking in the CO2 and allowing the oceans to dissolve more CO2 from the atmosphere. Ocean currents do the hard work of overcoming entropy and this mimics but accelerates natural basalt weathering. Of course this needs thoroughly researching, but could be MUCH cheaper and more effective than CCS!
There was a process that came out I think on the new inventors on the ABC quite a few years back, where they added a product to the manufacturing of concrete where once the concrete was set it would absorb CO2 for many years.","“CCUS is where a lot of the faith is.”

While 2020 will forever be remembered for the Covid-19 pandemic, it also continued the 21st Century’s run of warming climate trends. Indeed, 2020 was the hottest year on record not to feature an El Niño climate event, which would likely have boosted temperatures even higher. The mean temperature in 2020 was 13.9°C, around 1.2°C above the 20th Century average of 12.7°C. This was recorded despite a 7% year-on-year fall in CO2 emissions due to pandemic-related lockdowns, which did not prevent CO2 concentrations hitting 417ppm in January 2021. Atmospheric CO2 concentrations are now 50% higher than the pre-industrial 278ppm of the late 1700s and around 20% higher than in the early 1990s (~350ppm).
Build back better
As we emerge from the metaphorical rubble of the pandemic, construction activities, particularly cement and concrete, are increasingly under the spotlight of environmental campaigners, the wider public and national governments. There is good reason: Cement and concrete are responsible for ~7% of overall global CO2 emissions. This is related to not only the use of fuel-derived CO2 to heat the raw materials to 1400 - 1500°C, but also to the decarbonisation of calcium carbonate, the essential first step in the formation of clinker.
While the most forward-thinking producers can now point to a 30 year plus record of alternative fuels, clinker substitution, waste heat recovery and other efficiency gains, it is clear that the sector’s ‘traditional levers’ will be insufficient to reduce CO2 to the low levels required by the UN Paris Climate Agreement. Indeed, in April 2018 a report by the CDP looking at some of the largest multinational cement producers concluded that producers needed to double their emissions’ reductions in order to meet the 2°C global warming target outlined in the Paris Agreement. The report, entitled ‘Building Pressure,’ analysed 13 large cement companies including LafargeHolcim, HeidelbergCement and Cemex.
Beyond traditional levers
As national and international governments ramp up their own CO2 abatement targets with a view to meeting their obligations under the UN Paris Climate Agreement, cement producers have now set far bolder targets, both separately and jointly under the auspices of the sector’s two new international associations - the Global Cement & Concrete Association (GCCA) and the World Cement Association (WCA). Both of these were established in the late 2010s and each has a strong sustainability ethos.
Indeed, GCCA members, which represent 40% of the industry, have jointly committed to a low-carbon transition and the production of CO2-neutral concrete by 2050. The association’s 2050 Climate Ambition document was launched in September 2020, with a full Roadmap to be published by the close of 2021. Speaking with Global Cement, the GCCA’s CEO Dinah McLeod said “It represents the first time that the industry has come together to jointly state such a bold and wide-ranging set of sustainability targets.”
The WCA meanwhile, also supports a sustainable cement industry and encourages technical development and other steps to achieve full decarbonisation with the aim of keeping global temperatures to less than 2°C and as close as possible to 1.5°C. It is extremely active through the dissemination of best sustainability practices across its membership network and professional committees, including with those outside of the sector.
Regionally, Cembureau, the European Cement Association, has set out its Roadmap to achieve net-zero CO2 emissions along the cement and concrete value chain by 2050. Germany’s VDZ has done the same, its CEO Dr Martin Schneider noting that the potential for further gains from traditional sustainability measures is close to its limit, requiring a “Completely new approach to the production of cement and its use in concrete.” In North America, the Portland Cement Association has announced that it too will publish a Roadmap to carbon neutrality by 2050 by the end of 2021. Its Vice President for Sustainability Rick Bohan, said “Developing a roadmap to carbon neutrality by 2050 further demonstrates our industry’s commitment to be a part of the solution and tackle this global issue.”
Spain’s Oficemen recently announced that it would target a 43% emissions drop by 2030 across its entire value chain compared to 1990 levels. Finally, UK Concrete and the Mineral Products Association (MPA) have launched a roadmap for the concrete and cement industry in the UK to become net CO2 negative by 2050. It plans to do this through decarbonised electricity and transport networks, fuel switching, greater use of low-carbon cements and concretes as well as carbon capture, use or storage (CCUS) technology.
Cement producers’ targets
In 2020 cement producers introduced their boldest ever sustainability targets. Those of the largest firms, plus other notable cases, are outlined below.
China’s cement producers, many of which are ultimately controlled by the state, were committed en masse by President Xi’s commitment to reach a net zero CO2 economy by 2060 in September 2020. Data from the Centre for International Climate and Environmental Research (CICERO) shows that the Chinese cement industry emitted an estimated 782Mt CO2 in 2018 compared to 37.1Gt CO2 from all anthropogenic sources. This means that Chinese cement plants were responsible for a staggering 2% of all CO2 emissions in that year. If realised, this target would represent one of the larger pieces of the global zero-CO2 puzzle.
LafargeHolcim signed the Science-Based Targets initiative (SBTi) Business Ambition for 1.5°C pledge in September 2020. This commits it to net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050. It also committed to a 20% reduction in its CO2 intensity by 2030 against a 2018 baseline. This interim target, to hit 475kg of CO2 per tonne of cementitious material, will be partly backed up by a Euro850m sustainability-linked bond with a coupon of 0.5% that matures in 2031. Investors will be entitled to a higher coupon should the company not meet its emissions target.
HeidelbergCement has brought forward its former CO2 emissions target for 2030 of 525kg of CO2 per tonne of cement to 2025 as part of its Beyond 2020 programme. If achieved, this would represent a 30% decrease from 752kg of CO2 per tonne in 1990. Its new goal for 2030 is ‘below 500kg’. Its targets to 2030 have been successfully assessed against the Science Based Targets initiative’s (SBTi) criteria.
HeidelbergCement has also strengthened its climate neutrality commitments by joining the Stiftung 2° support group, a network of private companies lobbying for climate goals. The group says that it wants to ‘Develop cross-sector approaches and concepts for Germany and Europe in order to make climate protection a sustainable and successful business model.’
Cemex announced that Carbon Trust had validated its roadmap to decarbonise global operations in line with the Sectoral Decarbonisation Approach 2°C scenario developed by the International Energy Agency (IEA), in October 2020. It also aims to reduce its net CO2 emissions by 30% by 2030.
Dalmia Cement commited to below zero CO2 emissions by 2040 in 2019. In 2020 it joined five leading companies of other sectors in signing the Near-Zero pledge, an industry charter targeting near-zero CO2 emissions by 2050.
Sumitomo Osaka Cement has formulated a set of medium-term goals and long-term policies in order to enable it to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, in line with the Japanese government’s target. These include a 30% reduction in energy-derived CO2 emissions intensity between 2005 and 2030 and efforts toward carbon neutrality in energy and process-derived emissions by 2050.
Cementir Holding has set a CO2 emissions reduction target less than 500kg per of CO2 per tonne of cement by 2030.
Buzzi Unicem aims to reach a target of 662kg of CO2 per tonne of cement in 2022.
Taiheiyo Cement will reduce specific CO2 emissions by 80% between 2000 and 2050.
Vicem, the largest cement producer in Vietnam, and Danish cement sector supplier FLSmidth have announced a cooperation agreement with the aim of radically reducing the greenhouse gas emissions from Vicem’s activities, including an aim to use 100% alternative fuels.
Grupo Cementos de Chihuahua (GCC) has committed to setting scientifically-verified greenhouse gas reduction targets by joining the SBTi.
How can we do this?
The commitments above will be met using a combination of approaches. These include, but are not limited to, the increased use of biomass alternative fuels, waste heat recovery, process efficiency gains, automation, lower clinker cements, renewable power generation, novel fuels / heating systems, recarbonisation of concrete and CCUS. Many of the above have been covered previously, so this article will focus on four main areas:
1. Ultra-low CO2 mixtures;
2. Renewable power, including storage;
3. Novel fuels and heating technologies;
4. CO2 capture and utilisation / storage.
The content relates predominantly to the production of binder systems based on calcium carbonate. Note that the limited space available means that it will not be possible to include all examples and case-studies.
Ultra-low CO2 cement blends
The inclusion of supplementary cementitious materials, clinker extenders and other additives to substitute for a portion of the clinker in a cement blend is an extremely well established practice. However, many traditional blends remain far from the 60% clinker factor required by the Cement Sustainability Initiative’s (CSI) 2DS. This has led to the development of ultra-low CO2 cement blends, including ternary blends and those that do away with clinker altogether.
Low-CO2 producers
Several companies have been established specifically as low-CO2 cement producers:
Ecocem’s products are based on ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS), with the Irish firm claiming specific CO2 emissions as low as 12kg/t for its non-clinker containing ‘Ecocem’ product. It also produces CEM III / A, which contains >50% GGBS, and Ecocem Superfine, an additive with a specific area of 7000-8000cm2/g. The company makes these in Ireland, France and the Netherlands.
Hofman Green Cement, based in France, makes a range of low-CO2 from a variety of materials. H-P2A is a geopolymer binder made by mixing flash-calcined clay and silicates that are combined with Hofmann’s proprietary activators. H-EVA is an alkali-activated ettringite technology that combines flash-calcined clay, byproduct gypsum and Hofmann’s activators. H-UKR is a GGBS-based blend, which Hofmann claims has a CO2 footprint 80% lower than traditional concrete.
The company is in the process of building a new 0.25Mt/yr plant at the site of its existing Bornezeau 50,000t/yr plant in France’s Vendée region and a second 0.25Mt/yr plant in the region surrounding Paris, which will come online in 2024.
DB Group markets CemFree, an ultra-low CO2 cement alternative that reduces emissions by up to 80% compared to conventional mix, in the UK. CemFree is a proprietary alkali-activated cementitious material that activates pozzolanic materials such as ground granulated GGBS and pulverised fly ash. The company launched Wolfenden Concrete, which has CO2 emissions 62% lower than traditional concrete, with its partner Wolfenden Concrete in February 2021.
Celitement, now 100%-owned by Schwenk Zement, makes its eponymous product by heating calcium carbonate and silica-bearing minerals in a steam-saturated autoclave at a relatively cool 150-300°C. This produces a stable C-S-H rich ‘raw meal’ that can be activated by grinding. Celitement’s lower CO2 footprint is achieved predominantly through its lower process temperature.
BIGBOSS Cement, based in the Philippines, uses volcanic lahar material as a raw material, enabling it to produce cementitious binders that have a CO2 footprint around 50% of that of OPC.
Concrene is a UK-based nanotechnology firm that has developed the use of graphene (thin sheets of carbon atoms) in concrete products. The properties of graphene lead to a faster cure, 15 - 20% higher flexural and compressive strength, reduced cracking and very high hydrophobicity. The lower CO2 emissions of Concrene are derived from using less clinker to achieve the same strength.
Marta Abreu University in Cuba began the production of LC3 cement consisting of clinker, calcined clay, limestone and gypsum at a 1460t/yr pilot cement plant in Las Villas in October 2020.
Low-CO2 products
Many established cement producers have now brought low- or net-zero-CO2 cement and / or concrete products to market:
LafargeHolcim has introduced its EcoLabel to highlight products with at least 30% lower than average CO2 emissions or more than 20% recycled content. It has also launched of ECOPact green concrete products in Canada, Colombia, Ecuador, France, Gemany, Mexico, Switzerland, the UK and the US. These allow CO2 emissions reductions of 30-100% compared to using CEM I. For the range 70 - 100% the company uses offsetting schemes to compensate for the necessary CO2 released during clinker production. The company has also launched its Susteno cement product in Europe, which it claims is the only cement product that contains fine mixed granulate from demolished buildings as an additive.
Cementir Holding has developed its FutureCemTM technology, which uses clinker, calcined clay and limestone. This allows it to remove more than 40% of clinker from the blend and reduce CO2 emissions by 30%. It has been used at full-scale in infrastructure projects in Europe.
Cemex is currently rolling out its net-zero CO2 Vertua® concrete product worldwide following its release in Europe. The product, which has already found use in infrastructure projects in Europe, uses a geopolymer binder solution created by Cemex’s Research and Development Center in Switzerland. This solution has a reduced CO2 footprint of up to 70%. The compensation of the remaining CO2 is achieved by participating in reforestation projects, among other initiatives.
HeidelbergCement has developed i.tech 3D, a low-CO2 concrete blend developed specifically for the 3D printing of buildings. This is currently being used to construct Europe’s largest ever 3D printed structure in Bavaria, Germany. Its Hanson subsidiary markets GGBS-based binders in the UK under its Regen brand. In February 2021 its Lehigh Hanson subsidiary launched EcoCem Plus, which is made at its Edmonton cement plant in Alberta, Canada. The product is a blended Portland Limestone Cement (PLC) that comprises clinker, fly ash, limestone and gypsum, with CO2 emissions 22% lower than for standard cement.
Cementos Argos announced the completion of work on a new 0.45Mt/yr calcined clay production line at its Rio Claro plant in Colombia in February 2020. it will enable Cementos Argos to produce ternary cement blends with CO2 emissions 38% lower than for OPC. Energy consumption is also cut by 30%, which provides secondary benefits in terms of reduced off-site CO2 emissions.
Cimpor Global Holdings is in the process of building a clay calcination plant at its new integrated Kribi cement plant in the Port of Kribi in South Cameroon. The system, supplied by thyssenkrupp Industrial Solutions, will calcine clay at 800°C. This is then substituted for a third of the clinker in CEM I, lowering the finished cement’s clinker factor by up to 40%.
OYAK Group, the Turkish owner of Cimpor, announced in early 2020 that it planned to invest in pozzolan extraction in Cape Verde, where Cimpor has grinding plant assets.
Using SCMs more effectively
Reducing the amount of clinker in cement and concrete mixtures represents a low-cost and relatively low-research option to lower overall CO2 emissions, compared to other technologies. In his October 2020 article in Global Cement Magazine, cement consultant John Kline highlighted that, in addition to securing SCM supplies to use in low-CO2 products, producers should pay careful attention to the availability of the active calcium silicate hydrate component of the cement blend. Both the calcium oxide and silica need to be in a reactive form. All components, aggregates, sand, SCMs and cement must have carefully-controlled particle size distributions to fully allow reactions to take place and avoid the wastage of active ingredients. This effect can be seen with relation to the surprisingly high strength, and hence potential CO2 savings, of ternary blends that contain clinker, limstone and calcined clay. When particle sizes are not already optimised, Kline suggests that lower CO2 emissions can be achieved through separate grinding of clinker and individual SCMs.
Renewable energy
Due to the high demand for thermal energy and the nature of the clinker production process, electrical emissions from cement plants can often be sidelined. However, the CO2 emissions associated with power generation still account for around 10-15% of the overall total. Minimising this is thus essential for producers seeking net-zero CO2 emissions.
In many markets, electricity from wind and solar power is now cheaper than that made using fossil fuels, nuclear energy and geothermal plants in terms of cost per MWh. In recent years this has tipped the balance in favour of investment for numerous cement plants seeking quick and low-capex CO2 reduction. Solar panels or turbines can be installed in former quarry areas, on roofs or in other parts of the plant. Alternatively, producers can agree renewable energy supply agreements with utility suppliers. Projects and contracts dating from January 2020 to February 2021 are shown in Table 1.

Storage solutions
Despite their advantages in cost and sustainability, wind- and solar-generated electricity supplies are considerably less predictable than conventional sources. This leads to mismatches between demand and supply at the plant, forcing it to buy and sell power at different times.
This is a practical solution but one that will become increasingly unsatisfactory as the proportion of renewable energy increases. To provide more independence while ensuring that the CO2 benefits of renewable energy stay with the cement plant, there has been significant research in the field of intermediate energy storage, especially over multi-day timeframes. Potential solutions include:
- Batteries of various sizes and chemistries;
- Gravity storage: A heavy object is lifted using electrical power and later undergoes a controlled descent, regenerating electricity;
- Thermal batteries: Heat is transferred to high-capacity concrete blocks, ceramic blocks, pebbles or aluminium ingots;
- Kinetic storage, including flywheels.
- Electrolysis of water using renewable electricity to produce hydrogen and oxygen. These are stored and later combusted to provide heat.
While they are broadly hypothetical at the moment, the combination of such storage systems connected to industrial users and captive power generation facilities, the system as a whole is known as a microgrid. These can either be independent from or linked to the wider power network. In the cement sector they remain a concept, with storage the final piece of the puzzle. In the period to 2050, such systems could become widespread, expanding to provide power for electric site vehicles and quarry machinery, as well as delivery fleets.
Novel fuels and heating methods
The environmental benefits of using materials that would otherwise go to waste as cement plant fuels include the avoidance of landfill, lower production costs and, for biomass-derived fuels such as paper/card, waste wood and agricultural byproducts, lower CO2 emissions. These advantages have led alternative fuels to take hold in many European countries. They are also used to a lesser extent in North and South America and are gaining a foothold in most parts of Asia, the Middle East and Africa.
However, the proportion of fossil fuels used by the 21% of cement producers that submitted data to the GCCA’s Getting the Numbers Right (GNR) database in 2018 remained stubbornly high at 81.5%. Between them, petcoke and coal contributed 69.4% of the thermal energy used. Alternative fossil-based materials, for example waste plastics and oils, accounted for 12.1%, with biomass fuels contributing just 6.4% of the necessary thermal energy. There clearly remains a lot to be achieved using this particular traditional lever.
Very alternative fuels
The atmosphere doesn’t care if a cement plant burns oil straight from the ground or oil that was converted into a plastic bottle first, so even when a plant does reach an alternative fuel substitution rate of 100%, it may still have a lot of work to do to lower its CO2 emissions. Therefore, several approaches are being developed to optimise the combustion process or replace it with another process, while retaining clinker as the product. Some aim to eliminate fuel-based CO2 emissions entirely, while others clean up the gas flow to enable cheaper and easier CCS. Prominent examples include:
With fuels
Catch4Climate is a project comprising four cement producers: Buzzi Unicem subsidiary Dyckerhoff, HeidelbergCement, Schwenk Zement and Vicat. The consortium intends to build and operate its own oxyfuel demonstration plant on a semi-industrial scale. Oxyfuel combustion uses an enhanced O2 atmosphere, rather than ambient air, to increase combustion efficiency and simplify CO2 capture. In the future, the captured CO2 will be used to produce so-called ‘reFuels’, climate-neutral synthetic fuels such as kerosene for air traffic, with the help of renewable electrical energy. The project is now planning a pilot plant at Schwenk Zement’s Mergelstetten cement plant.
The European Cement Research Academy (ECRA) has selected HeidelbergCement’s Colleferro plant in Italy and LafargeHolcim’s Retznei plant in Austria as demonstration plants for two oxyfuel combustion projects. The costs of the test phase will be around Euro80m.
Hanson Cement’s Ribblesdale plant in North Yorkshire, UK is the subject of a study in the use of biomass and hydrogen fuels coordinated by the Mineral Products Association (MPA), with the aim of achieving 100% fossil-fuel-free operation. The Euro7m project, due to be completed by the end of March 2021, is being funded by the UK Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) and has been awarded through the MPA. It follows a BEIS-funded feasibility study in 2019, which found that a combination of 70% biomass, 20% hydrogen and 10% plasma energy could be used to eliminate fossil fuel CO₂ emissions from cement manufacturing entirely.
AC2OCem, a project coordinated by the University of Stuttgart, will conduct pilot-scale experiments and analytical studies to advance key components of oxyfuel cement plants with the aim of reducing the time to market of the oxyfuel technology in the cement sector. Its current funding period runs from November 2019 to the autumn of 2022.
The Westküste100 green hydrogen project intends to produce green hydrogen, transport it in the gas network, use it in industrial processes and to interlink different material cycles within the existing infrastructure in Germany. The consortium brings together 10 partners: Holcim Deutschland, EDF Deutschland, OGE, Ørsted Deutschland, Raffinerie Heide, Heide’s municipal utility, Thüga and ThyssenKrupp Industrial Solutions, along with the Region Heide development agency and the Westküste University of Applied Sciences.
“An electrolysis plant with a capacity of 700MW. This is our vision and the next milestone in implementing the development targets laid down in the national hydrogen strategy by 2030,” said Jürgen Wollschläger, managing director of Raffinerie Heide and coordinator of the Westküste100 project.
Without fuels
Cemex announced the signing of a collaboration agreement with Switzerland-based alternative fuel specialist Synhelion in October 2020. The pair aims to develop the use of solar power as an alternative heat source to fuel in clinker production. In Synhelion’s process, a classic solar tower configuration focuses radiation on a single point from a large number of reflectors, where it heats a mixture of CO2 and H2O gases trapped in a chamber, heating the mixture to 1550°C. In the project with Cemex, this hot gas mixture will be fed to the calciner, where it will heat the raw meal in the same way as a flame, just in the absence of any fuel. Pilot testing of Synhelion’s technology at an as-yet unannounced Cemex plant is slated for late 2022.
Heliogen, based in California, US, has developed concentrated solar-thermal plants (CSPs) with the ability to focus sunlight to generate temperatures over 1000°C by micro-adjusting mirrors using computer technology. It has now engaged Parsons Corporation to build arrays of its CSPs for installation in cement pre-calciners. Requiring temperatures of 900°C, these represent the largest part of the industry’s CO2 output.
Heliogen CEO Bill Gross says that the installations will make CCS of the remaining CO2 emissions from the conversion of limestone to lime easier by removing other pollutants. Heliogen is now targeting 1500°C from its CSPs, which would enable them to supersede cement fuels in kilns.
Cementa, HeidelbergCement Swedish subsidiary, and utility provider Vattenfall reported on the pilot stage results of their CemZero project in February 2019. These showed that the technical prerequisites exist for electrified cement production via the generation of high-temperature plasma. The study gives the green light to investigating how a pilot plant can be built.
CO2 capture and utilisation / storage
All of the roadmaps discussed in the introduction make no secret of the fact that ‘novel technologies’ will be required to achieve a net-zero CO2 cement sector. While some have been discussed in previous sections, the bulk of this task is likely to fall on CO2 capture and utilisation / storage (CCU/S). Such technology is currently very expensive, but competition and scale-up should change with time, although incentives (see below) will remain important for some time to come.
CO2 capture and utilisation (CCU)
CCU is where captured CO2 emissions are used to form products that can be used by the cement plant or sold to another user. Examples include:
Buzzi Unicem’s Vernasca cement plant saw the inauguration of the pilot plant for the Cleanker project in October 2020. The plant uses calcium looping technology that captures CO2 using raw meal as a sorbent.
Carmeuse has signed a joint development agreement with France-based energy transition specialist ENGIE and John Cockerill for a CCU project in Belgium. It will concentrate CO2 from a novel lime kiln and combine it with renewably-generated hydrogen to produce ‘e-methane,’ which can be used by industrial users or as a transport fuel. Construction is due to begin in 2022, with commissioning to follow in 2025.
CarbonCure is a prominent Canadian company that sells technology to inject recycled CO2 into fresh concrete, permanently mineralising it while adding strength. It sources some of its CO2 from the Cementos Argos Roberta plant in Georgia, US.
Carbicrete, based in Canada, directly injects CO2 into a wet GGBS-based concrete mixture, a process called carbonation activation. CO2 is permanently sequestered.
Cemex is involved in a working group looking to implement FastCarb aggregates into concrete production. Administrated by the US-based International Research and Exchanges Board, FastCarb is developing a process to make aggregates from recycled concrete containing waste CO2.
Vicat started using a CO2ntainer system supplied by UK-based Carbon8 Systems at its Montalieu-Vercieu cement plant in November 2020. It uses captured CO2 from the unit’s flue gas emissions to carbonate cement-plant dust, producing aggregates.
Solidia is a patented cement and concrete technology that uses two core principles: a reduction in reaction temperature and the use of CO2 to cure the concrete.
Mitsubishi Group is researching the injection of CO2 into concrete in a project alongside Kajima Corporation and Chugoku Electric Power. They aim to develop an existing approach towards the production of cast-in-place concrete sections.
Sumitomo Osaka Cement is working on CO2 mineralisation research project with Yamaguchi University, Kyushu University and the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organisation. The partners are developing a process that captures CO2 exhaust from cement and power plants and then mineralises it with calcium-containing waste materials, with the aim of commercial use by 2030.
Cemex is working with Canada-based Carbon Upcycling Technologies to improve the cementitious properties of residues such as fly ash and steel slag by physically processing them into more active nanomaterials using captured CO2.
Lafarge Zementwerke, OMV, Verbund and Borealis have signed a memorandum of understanding for the joint planning and construction of a full-scale plant to capture CO2 and process it into synthetic fuels, plastics or other chemicals by 2030. As part of the ‘Carbon2ProductAustria’ (C2PAT) project, the companies intend to build the unit at the integrated Mannersdorf cement plant and capture all of the 0.7Mt/yr of CO2 emitted. The project aims to use hydrogen produced by Verbund to allow OMV to transform the captured CO2 into a range of olefins, fuels and plastics.
Schwenk Zement announced plans for the production of sustainable aviation fuel from the waste CO2 from its Allmendingen plant in Baden-Württemberg in 2020.
Dalmia Cement will install large-scale CCU at its Ariyalur plant in Tamil Nadu, India in 2022 at the latest. An agreement was signed with UK-based Carbon Clean Solutions Limited to use its technology for a 0.5Mt/yr facility in 2019. The partnership has explored how CO2 from the plant can be used, including direct sales to other industries and using the CO2 as a precursor in manufacturing chemicals.
CO2 capture and storage (CCS)
CCS is where large volumes of CO2 are permanently stored underground. Examples include:
HeidelbergCement’s Brevik plant in Norway is home to arguably the best-known CCS project in the cement sector. Now 10 years in development, the 1.2Mt/yr plant will be fitted with Aker Solutions’ amine-based CCS technology to sequester ~0.4Mt/yr of CO2 under the sea as part of the Norwegian government’s Longship demonstration project and the Northern Lights project for permanent storage. It is expected to be in operation by 2024.
LafargeHolcim and CO2 capture technology firm Svante are developing a full-scale CCS solution at the Holcim Portland plant in Florence, Colorado, US as part of the CO2MENT project. Svante has developed an extremely high surface area metal-organic framework (MOF), which traps CO2 directly from industrial exhaust streams. It is expected that the project will be commissioned in 2024-2025. The partners are also developing the technology at the Lafarge Canada plant in Richmond, British Columbia, Canada.
HeidelbergCement’s Lixhe plant in Belgium has been a key part of the Low Emissions Intensity Lime And Cement (LEILAC) consortium as a test-bed for Calix’s Direct Separation Reactor (DSR) since 2018. The DSR separates fuel and process gas streams during the cement production process. This simplifies the process of condensing and storing the process CO2. Following strong results from Lixhe, a second demonstration plant, LEILAC 2, will be installed at HeidelbergCement’s Hanover plant in Germany.This will capture 20% of the cement plant’s capacity, corresponding to around 100,000t/yr of CO2. Including design, construction, commissioning and extensive testing, the overall project is expected to be completed by 2025. Cemex is also a participant in the consortium.
Lehigh Cement (HeidelbergCement) and the International CCS Knowledge Centre are conducting a CCS feasibility study at its Edmonton, Alberta cement plant to find out whether capturing 90-95% of the plant’s CO2 is viable. Completion of the study is scheduled for the autumn of 2021.
Cemex subsidiary Cemex Ventures is working with US-based CCS specialist Carbon Clean toward the development of a CCS solution for under US$30 per tonne of CO2 captured. Cemex is also working with Membrane Technology & Research’s membrane CCS product at its Balcones plant in Texas, US.
Oficemen, the Spanish cement association has announced that it is working with the Spanish Technological Platform for CO2 (PTECO2) to identify potential locations for storing CO2 captured from cement plants.
C-Capture, from the UK, has developed a non-amine solvent for use in CCS. The mechanism by which it absorbs and releases CO2 means it breaks down less easily than amines. C-Capture’s says that its technology uses 40% less energy than other available technologies.
Concluding remarks
The development of a net-zero CO2 cement and concrete sector is a daunting task, one that will continue to fill issues of this publication for decades to come. The many products, projects, case-studies and opportunities discussed above highlight the vast array of innovative solutions that the cement sector and its partners are bringing to the fight against climate change... ...and they are just the start.
No single country, company or technology will provide ‘the answer,’ alone. In their quest towards net-zero-CO2, companies must coordinate their efforts and draw on each others’ experience, a strategy that goes against decades of traditional business practice. In this regard the sector’s associations - GCCA, WCA, Cembureau, PCA and others - will play an increasingly important role in coordinating collaboration on sustainability issues, while keeping their members free to compete in the business of selling cement.
International associations also have an important role to communicate the cement sector’s needs to policy makers, and coordinate sustainability efforts with those outside of the sector. As the examples above show, assistance from waste processors, iron and steel manufacturers, gas handling experts, renewable energy, battery manufacturers and besides will inform and shape the cement industry of the future.","The group says that it wants to ‘Develop cross-sector approaches and concepts for Germany and Europe in order to make climate protection a sustainable and successful business model.’
Cemex announced that Carbon Trust had validated its roadmap to decarbonise global operations in line with the Sectoral Decarbonisation Approach 2°C scenario developed by the International Energy Agency (IEA), in October 2020. The partners are developing a process that captures CO2 exhaust from cement and power plants and then mineralises it with calcium-containing waste materials, with the aim of commercial use by 2030. In this regard the sector’s associations - GCCA, WCA, Cembureau, PCA and others - will play an increasingly important role in coordinating collaboration on sustainability issues, while keeping their members free to compete in the business of selling cement."

CONSTRUCTION has started on a £13 million project to reduce the carbon footprint of Lafarge Cement’s Cauldon cement plant, in Staffordshire.
This will be achieved by building a new pre-processing plant for the storage, handling and feeding of solid alternative fuels, that would otherwise end up as landfill. In addition, a new chloride bypass will be installed, which will ensure quality of product and result in no additional waste.
The world-class Cauldon operation, which was the first dry-process cement plant in the UK, is part of Aggregate Industries, who themselves are owned by LafargeHolcim – one of the world leaders in carbon-reduction initiatives, having recently committed to their net-zero climate pledge.
Steve Curley, managing director - cement, said: ‘We have a successful history at Cauldon of moving away from the traditional use of fossil fuels and instead utilizing renewable fuel sources.
‘This investment marks the next step forward for our sustainable future, allowing us to provide a circular economy by recycling waste supplied to us by reputable organizations that are approved against our strict specification standards, and then using it as fuel within our production process.’
After extensive consultation with the local community and other stakeholders, the project started construction in March 2021 and is due to complete in early 2022.
The project consists of two parts, the first being the new pre-processing facility with a haulage and feeding platform which will be constructed across the road from the main plant and connected via an innovative conveyor that fully contains the waste fuel during transfer to the plant. This facility will provide 100,000 tonnes of waste fuel per year to the main plant, utilizing materials that would otherwise go to landfill.
The second part of the project is the new chlorine bypass, which is being built into the existing kiln equipment in the main cement plant. The new bypass will remove any additional chlorine which may be present due to the use of the new fuel sources, ensuring a consistent high-quality product is still produced. The excess chlorine will be utilized at the end of the process, resulting in no additional waste materials.
The new chloride bypass and pre-processing facilities will reduce carbon dioxide emissions at the plant by 30,000 tonnes annually
Dragan Maksimovic, chief executive officer of Aggregate Industries UK, said: ‘It’s great to see us continuing to recognize the importance of sustainability and invest in Cauldon cement plant to ensure that we further reduce carbon emissions and remain sustainable for the long term, both as a local employer and contributor to the local economy, as well as a UK-wide supplier of high-quality products and services.’

yullz/iStock Editorial via Getty ImagesHolcim (OTCPK:HCMLF), a leading global cement, aggregates, and concrete producer, recently held its Capital Markets Day event, outlining an accelerated path to 'Strategy 2025' following the achievement of its fiscal 2022 targets a year early. Nonetheless, the updated targets seem slightly conservative, especially in the near term, considering Holcim's plans to raise prices by 5% in the upcoming year, allowing room for flat or negative volume growth ahead. Perhaps more importantly, however, the messages below the surface on M&A-led growth and the continued focus on cash flow support a compelling ESG-led portfolio shift over the medium to longer term. In light of the positive strategy update, Holcim appears well-positioned as the clear leader on decarbonization, and with shares offering a c. 12% FCF yield (or c. 8x P/FCF), I see plenty of room for a re-rating. Broadly In-Line 2025 Targets Could Prove Conservative Holcim's updated financial targets offered few surprises – key targets include a 3-5% net sales growth on a like-for-like basis (equivalent to Strategy 2022), along with an increase in recurring EBIT. To achieve this, the company will accelerate growth across all markets, leveraging innovative building solutions. In addition, Holcim will also fuel the growth with bolt-on acquisitions in mature markets across the aggregates and ready-mix concrete businesses while also scaling up digitalization across the value chain. This should support the planned expansion of the Solutions & Products segment to c. 30% of group sales (up from the current c. 12%). Also worth noting is the double-digit ROIC target, which should ensure accretive M&A ahead.
Source: Holcim CMD Presentation Slides While the headline 3-5% top-line growth is solid, I would note that the net sales growth target had already been outlined at Strategy 2022, implying no actual growth acceleration relative to the current run rate. In light of the secular tailwinds at play, including the growth dynamics in roofing, multiple construction megatrends, and the current elevated cost inflation to be passed on via pricing (+5% in fiscal 2021), however, there could be some conservatism embedded in these growth targets. With Firestone also posting double-digit % growth in sales and remaining on track to double to c. $4 billion by fiscal 2025 (relative to $1.8 billion in fiscal 2020) via strategic investments and acquisitions, I see plenty of upside to these numbers in the upcoming years. Roll-Out of Sustainable Products to Underpin Shift to a 'Value-Based' Model With a transition in the overall sales mix likely insufficient considering the weight of current and future earnings in cement, Holcim is pushing for growth in its lower CO2 alternative products while also de-carbonizing its industrial processes. Encouragingly, the ESG focus is accompanied by management's aim to achieve this goal profitably via a move away from a volume to a 'value-based' business model. This entails a commercial strategy focused on the rebranded EcoPact (lower carbon concrete) and EcoPlanet (lower carbon cement) offerings. Thus far, the approach has seen some success, with its ""EcoPlanet"" range already accounting for c. 12% of cement revenues on the back of a 5+% price premia.
Source: Holcim CMD Presentation Slides I view the proposed product development strategy as challenging in light of the commoditized nature of cement, although the early traction is positive. A strategy built around de-commoditizing has not been realistic historically, but perhaps with decarbonization on the agenda globally, it makes sense to move in this direction. Looking ahead, the key will be for Holcim to move (and stay) ahead of the curve as most other producers will likely follow suit, potentially pressuring the premium pricing strategy. With this in mind, I like that Holcim is also positioning itself as a solution provider to capture the higher value products that will be needed as this trend accelerates – for instance, the company is venturing into 3D printing, which is set to considerably reduce the tonnage of material required in a project over the longer term. Capital Allocation Policies Support Longer-Term Portfolio Shift Looking ahead, M&A will likely play a key role in driving the overall product mix change in the upcoming years – specifically, I see a combination of cement-related divestments (especially assets in higher-risk emerging markets) and acquisitions in the Products & Solutions segment as the most likely outcome. Recent acquisitions such as Firestone have been crucial in taking Holcim into non-cementitious product categories, and therefore, the scope of future expansion appears relatively broad. The key for Holcim will be finding suitable potential candidates in line with the c. 10% post-tax ROIC target at reasonable valuations. Meanwhile, the company has also been active on divestments, delivering c. $3.1 billion in EV over the 2019-2021 period ($4.1 billion including the divestments signed for fiscal 2022 in Brazil). Additional divestments will likely focus on exiting non-strategic markets to fund strategic acquisitions while maintaining a solid balance sheet.
Source: Holcim CMD Presentation Slides (Performance) Encouragingly, management seems confident in keeping FCF generation strong as well, on the back of a c. 45% cash conversion (up from the prior 40+%) and controlled capex spend (despite the planned ramp-up in 'green"" capex). In turn, this should support a lower leverage profile at sub-1.5x (below the previous sub-2x target). At present, management has not specifically guided toward an updated scope for incrementally improved cash returns or a share buyback, leaving room for an upside surprise on the capital return front. Final Take The extensive insights from the CMD were positive, especially the CEO's message regarding similar pricing expected in fiscal 2022 (+5%), although the company's new medium-term targets remain broadly in line with expectations. Ultimately, the key will be in the execution, including in the implementation of its planned decarbonization and expansion in building products ahead. If successful, the market could start rewarding leaders in lower (but not yet zero) CO2 products in the existing cement business, leading to a re-rating in the shares over time as the company pivots to higher growth/return building product businesses. At current levels, shares present compelling value at c. 8x P/FCF.

LafargeHolcim, ECOncrete turn tide on offshore wind turbine base scour
November 5, 2021November 12, 2021 Concrete News
LafargeHolcim and specialty precast developer ECOncrete Tech Ltd. are teaming to design and fabricate scour protection units equal to offshore wind turbine foundations’ hydrodynamic loads, configured to facilitate marine organism growth, and meeting seabed stabilization standards. Their three-year research & development effort envisions a pilot project to evaluate units’ ecological performance in an offshore environment, ahead of full-scale installations.
“Offshore energy production is a rapidly growing market worldwide, and while there are certainly benefits of using renewable energy, there is also an impact of structures on sensitive underwater ecosystems,” says ECOncrete Tech Co-Founder and CEO Dr. Ido Sella. “We view our collaboration with LafargeHolcim in the U.S. as key to minimizing this impact.”
LafargeHolcim and ECOncrete Tech researchers will pursue precast scour protection units that prevent currents from sweeping away sediments and resist the hydrodynamic force-rooted formation of holes around turbine foundations.
“We recognize there are many paths to achieving our net zero commitment, and most require innovative partnerships and out-of-the-box thinking,” adds LafargeHolcim Vice President, Commercial Excellence Josep Maset, invoking parent company Holcim AG’s stand on carbon dioxide emissions reduction through 2050. “The work with ECOncrete Tech is a notable example of searching for solutions that enable increased use of renewable energy in an environmentally responsible way.”
A White House goal of creating 30 gigawatts of offshore wind turbine-derived power by 2030 calls for protecting biodiversity and promoting ocean co-use—goals hinging on technologies for sustaining marine environment and species. The scour protection that LafargeHolcim and ECOncrete target would be the first structural solution to address turbines’ ecological impacts on the marine environment.
Through a New York City office, Tel Aviv-based ECOncrete Tech has a five-year record of demonstrating marine organism-friendly precast concrete concepts, owing especially to New York Harbor, Long Island Sound and Port of San Diego block installations. Work with LafargeHolcim commenced earlier this year under a grant from the Binational Industrial Research and Development (BIRD) program, supported by the National Institute of Standards and Technology and Israel Ministry of Economy and Industry/Office of the Chief Scientist. A 2016 BIRD grant helped usher ECOncrete Tech into the North American market, Besser Co. its inaugural R&D partner.

https://news.engineering.utoronto.ca/u-of-t-engineering-professor-on-a-mission-to-lower-concretes-carbon-footprint/,"Thu, 14 Oct 2021 07:00:00 GMT",U of T Engineering professor on a mission to lower concrete's carbon footprint - U of T Engineering News - U of T Engineering News,"For Professor Doug Hooton (CivMin), the challenge isn’t really the chemistry or the engineering. It’s trust.
“Construction is a very conservative industry, and it’s very decentralized,” he says. “You have building owners, architects, structural engineers, contractors and their tradesmen. None of them want to increase their risk by doing something different from what’s been done before.”
For more than a decade, Hooton and his team have been demonstrating that a few simple adjustments to the formulation of concrete can significantly reduce its environmental impact, without affecting its cost or performance.
They have conducted extensive field trials, and Hooton has even written standards to encourage the use of these modified materials. But it has been slow going.
“All of this stuff is really just the low-hanging fruit,” he says. “You’d think it would be a no-brainer, but it isn’t.”
The challenge with concrete starts with the chemistry of one of its key ingredients: Portland cement. To make it, producers mix limestone — which is mostly calcium carbonate — with various clay minerals and process it through a kiln at very high temperatures.
In the kiln, the calcium loses its carbon, which is driven off as CO2 gas, and then combines with silica, alumina and other elements in the clay to create clinker — the precursor to cement. Portland cement is then made by grinding clinker together with gypsum into a fine power.
The carbon dioxide gas emitted during the kiln reactions, combined with emissions from burning fossil fuels to heat the kiln, mean that for every kilogram of cement clinker produced, a nearly equivalent mass of CO2 is emitted.
One way to address this challenge is to change the formulations of the cementing materials to lower their carbon footprints. Hooton has championed national and international standards for a material known as Portland-limestone cement, which replaces up to 15% of the final cement powder with ground raw limestone.
The resulting material is a drop-in replacement for Portland cement in concrete, and is able to meet the same performance standards, as Hooton has shown through laboratory experiments and field trials.
“For example, one of the concerns that has been raised is the idea that this type of cement might be susceptible to attack by sulphates,” he says. “Sulphate minerals are common in soils in Western Canada, and can degrade some types of concrete if they are not designed for it.”
Through the NSERC/Cement Association of Canada Industrial Research Chair in Concrete Durability and Sustainability, Hooton initiated a field trial that has now been running for 11 years. His team cast more than 1,000 beams of concrete, some made with traditional Portland cement, and others made with Portland-limestone cement. All the beams were then exposed to aggressive sulphate solutions.
“We take them out and look at them every year,” he says. “The ones made with Portland-limestone cement are fine, in fact they’re actually performing better than many traditional concretes that have been specifically designed to stand up to sulphates.”
In addition to pure limestone, Hooton and his team have also tested other potential cement clinker replacements for use in concrete. One of these is a substance known as blast furnace slag, a waste product of the iron and steel industry, which can be mixed with either Portland cement and Portland-limestone cement at levels of up to 75%. This cuts the overall amount of cement used, lowering emissions proportionally.
“A switch to Portland-limestone cement, followed by a substitution of 35 to 40% slag would cut the carbon footprint of the resulting concrete by about half,” says Hooton.
Hooton says that one of the concerns about using slag is that at high replacement levels, it slows down the time it takes for the concrete to gain strength. This affects the early-age strength required to allow different construction operations, though the final strength is the same.
“We build structures to last 100 years, not just a few weeks,” he says. “So the final strength, which you reach at about 90 days, is what matters. On that timeline, we’ve shown that blast furnace slag mixed with Portland-limestone cement actually works better than with Portland cement because of reactions that happen between carbon in the limestone and alumina compounds in the slag.”
To deal with the early-age strength issue, Hooton and his team have done research on advanced testing methods. Currently, most standards for cement and concrete are based on testing the strength of the material after 28 days.
While this is sufficient time for traditional Portland cement to develop its properties, as noted above, some cement replacements can lengthen this timeline. Specifiers are resistant to adopting new protocols that will take two or three times as long as those they are used to.
“We can accelerate the testing process by increasing concrete temperature,” says Hooton. “It’s not rocket science, and we’ve known how to do it for decades. If we can give you a good indicator at 28 days of what’s going to happen at 90 days, it might grease the wheels in terms of getting these alternative materials more widely adopted.”
Hooton’s views and evidence carry weight: he serves as the chair of the CSA Group’s Committee on Concrete Materials and Methods of Concrete Construction and the chair of the Durability of Concrete committee of the American Concrete Institute. He is also the chair of the ASTM International committee on cements.
But he points out that simply creating standards is not enough to have lower-carbon footprint materials used in practice. To this end, he recently partnered with a team of experts on a new initiative aimed at identifying the barriers to rapid adoption of carbon reduction technologies in the North American concrete industry
The collaboration includes Dr. Tom Van Dam of NCE, an American engineering consulting firm, Professor Larry Sutter of Michigan Technological University and Al Innis, a former Vice-President of Lafarge-Holcim, one of the world’s leading manufacturers of building materials.
“In phase 1 of this project , we’re looking at the overall flows of cements, from where it’s produced to where it’s utilized, and identifying the barriers to adoption of more sustainable cementitious materials at each point along that chain,” he says.
“After that, we’re going to be developing a plan to systematically address those barriers.

Over the last couple of days, the world's largest cement manufacturer, one of the world's largest fossil fuel firms and the founder of the biggest electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer have all unveiled strategic efforts to commercialise carbon capture and storage projects.
The International Energy Agency has said that CCS is “virtually the only technology solution for deep emissions reductions from cement production” if the world is to deliver net-zero emissions by mid-century and alleviate the worst impacts of the climate crisis.
The total global capacity of CCS facilities operating and under development saw a 33% year-on-year increase in 2020. In the early days of 2021, it seems this trajectory will continue with LafargeHolcim, ExxonMobil and a new venture from Elon Musk all set to explore and uncover routes to commercialisation for CCS technology.
LafargeHolcim
The world’s largest cement manufacturer, LafargeHolcim, has unveiled a new strategic partnership with Schlumberger New Energy to explore the development of CCS solutions in a bid to reaching net-zero emissions by 2050.
The two companies will study CCS feasibility at two LafargeHolcim cement plants, based in Europe and North America. The partnership will explore the viability of Schlumberger’s carbon sequestration technologies in industrial applications.
LafargeHolcim’s chief sustainability officer Magali Anderson said: “Today’s announcement is further proof of LafargeHolcim’s environmental leadership and commitment to pioneer new solutions to reduce carbon emissions on our journey to become a net-zero company. Our partnership with Schlumberger, the world’s leading provider of technology to the global energy industry, will bring new advances in storage that could be replicated at scale across our sites.”
LafargeHolcim is currently piloting more than 20 CCS projects across Europe and North America. It is hoped CCS will enable the company to opening and operating its first net-zero carbon cement production facility in the future.
Late last year, the company priced an €850m bond linked to the company’s sustainability targets.
LafargeHolcim’s €850m sustainability-linked bond comes with a “coupon bond” – a debt obligation representing interest payments – of 0.5% that matures in 2031. Investors into the bond will access a higher coupon yield if the company is unable to meet the sustainability targets tied to the bond, including an aim to reduce emissions to 475 kg net CO2 per tonne of cementitious material by 2030. The CO2 target was recently unveiled by the company as part of a new set of decarbonisation goals.
LafargeHolcim has committed to becoming the first global building materials company to have targets approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). The company has joined the SBTi’s Business Ambition for 1.5°C, committing to science-based targets aligned to the highest ambition of the Paris Agreement, with a long-term trajectory of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050 at the latest.
Intermediate targets have been set for 2030 to reduce scope 1 and 2 emissions by 21% per tonne of cementitious materials against a 2018 baseline. This target will see scope 1 emissions reduced by 17.5% and scope 2 emissions by 65% in the same timeframe. LafargeHolcim will reduce its transportation and fuel-related emissions by 20%. All of these targets have been approved by the SBTi.
XPrize
The announcement comes in the same week that Tesla co-founder Elon Musk pledged to provide $100m for CCS solutions that remove atmospheric carbon dioxide and emissions.
XPrize team will manage the $100M carbon capture prize https://t.co/fSw5IanL0r
— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) February 9, 2021
A total of 15 solutions will be selected for the competition, which is expected to last until 2025. Selected innovations will each receive $1m to assist in project development, but the first-place prize of $50m is also available. Full competition guidelines will be published on 22 April, but it has been reported that technologies must be able to remove one tonne of CO2 per day.
“This is not a theoretical competition; we want teams that will build real systems that can make a measurable impact and scale to a gigaton level,” Musk said.
ExxonMobil
Finally, ExxonMobil has confirmed the creation of a “Low-Carbon Solutions” arm that will invest $3bn in low-emission solutions through to 2025, with an initial focus on CCS.
ExxonMobil Low Carbon Solutions plans to develop more than 20 CCS opportunities globally and will be led by Joe Blommaert, who has more than 30 years of experience in the industry.
While the company is one of the world’s largest emitters, it also claims that it has an equity share in about 20% of global CO2 capture capacity and has captured approximately 40% of all the captured anthropogenic CO2 in the world.
“With our demonstrated leadership in carbon capture and emissions reduction technologies, ExxonMobil is committed to meeting the demand for affordable energy while reducing emissions and managing the risks of climate change,” the company’s chief executive Darren Woods said.
“We are focused on proprietary projects and commercial partnerships that will have a demonstrably positive impact on our own emissions as well as those from the industrial, power generation and commercial transportation sectors, which together account for 80% of global CO2 emissions. We have the expertise that can help bring technologies to market and make a meaningful difference.”

https://www.architectmagazine.com/awards/lafargeholcim-names-north-american-next-generation-prize-winners_o,"Wed, 16 Jun 2021 06:41:33 GMT",LafargeHolcim Names North American Next Generation Prize Winners - ARCHITECT Magazine,"The following is a press release from international building materials manufacturer LafargeHolcim announcing the North American winners of its Next Generation prize. The triennial competition is held in five global regions and then worldwide, and offers $2 million in prize money. The winners of each global region will be announced throughout this week.
The LafargeHolcim Awards are the world’s most significant competition for sustainable design. The Next Generation category recognizes the visionary concepts and bold ideas of young professionals and students. In the competition region of North America, the jury selected four entries to receive Next Generation prizes. The winning projects all address fundamental issues and challenges.
The issue of sustainability in the construction sector is of paramount importance because the construction and maintenance of buildings accounts for 40 percent of both energy and material consumption worldwide. In view of climate change and diminishing resources, new approaches are needed along the entire value chain of the construction industry. Developing and applying these new approaches are what the LafargeHolcim Awards promote. Every three years, the competition is held in five world regions and then globally. The prize money totals USD 2 million.
The number of entries shows how intensively specialists from the fields of architecture, engineering, urban planning, materials science, construction technology, and related disciplines deal with sustainability issues: A total of 4,742 projects from 134 countries were submitted. About half of them fully met the competition requirements and were then scrutinized in extensive online jury meetings in the five competition regions. The juries spent a total of over 100 hours sifting through and ranking the winners in the Main and Next Generation categories. In this process, they used the five Target Issues for Sustainable Construction with which the LafargeHolcim Foundation assesses sustainability. Summarized as Progress, People, Planet, Prosperity, and Place, the Target Issues outline the critical factors of making the environments we build and inhabit truly viable as the building sector moves toward net-zero emissions and circular material flows.
Many high-level Next Generation entries
The Next Generation category seeks visionary concepts and is open to participants up to 30 years of age, whereas the Main category is for projects that are ready for implementation. In the current competition, around half of the entries worldwide were submitted in the Next Generation category. “Identifying only a small group of winners among a strong pool of submissions was challenging,” says Reed Kroloff. The Rowe Family Dean of the College of Architecture at Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT) served as head of the jury for North America. The jury included professionals from across the region: Sarah Burch (Canada Research Chair in Sustainability Governance & Innovation, University of Waterloo, Canada), Sarah Graham (agps architecture, USA), Mitchell Joachim (Terreform ONE, USA), Sharon Johnston (Johnston Marklee & Associates, USA), Jesse LeCavalier (Associate Professor, John H Daniels Faculty of Architecture, Landscape, & Design, University of Toronto, Canada), Christophe Levy (Scientific Director and Director R&D Concrete & Aggregates, LafargeHolcim Innovation Center, France), and Sarah Whiting (Dean, Graduate School of Design (GSD), Harvard University, USA). A further jury member from the LafargeHolcim Foundation Academic Committee was Marilyne Andersen (Professor of Sustainable Construction Technologies, EPFL Lausanne, Switzerland).
Each winning idea highlights a different perspective of sustainability
During the selection process, the jury of experts had many discussions inspired by the projects: ""about sustainability in general and about the increasing complexity of building responsibly on this continent and the others,"" says jury head Reed Kroloff. Ultimately, the jury also judged the entries on whether they broadened the perspective and, in addition to a specific problem solution, also had the big picture of sustainability in mind. It is therefore not surprising that, as Reed Kroloff says, “there was a strong focus on reuse, either upcycling or downcycling of materials, and the incorporation of plans and natural systems into the solutions.” The winning projects also share another thing in common: “Each of the winners proposed fascinating and elegant responses to the challenges and opportunities sustainability represents as part of the design process,” says the jury head, and he broadly characterizes the selected projects as “hopeful.”
In addition to the prize money, each winner receives a personalized trophy featuring the Modulor of the Swiss architect Le Corbusier. The trophy base is made of ECOPact, a low-carbon concrete by LafargeHolcim, showcasing materials that enable circular flows and carbon-neutral construction. LafargeHolcim is the sponsor of the LafargeHolcim Foundation, which conducts the competition. “With their fresh ideas, the Next Generation Awards prize winners keep us at the forefront of sustainable and innovative building solutions”, says Jan Jenisch, CEO of LafargeHolcim.
1st prize: Reuse instead of demolition
Countless old concrete buildings will be torn down in the coming years. There is still no standard method for properly disposing of the resulting debris, only for downcycling the concrete. The project by Daniel Marshall, MIT Cambridge, shows how dismantled elements such as floor slabs can be used in the construction of new buildings. “It shows how we could make ‘reuse rather than destroy’ the default plan for the building industry,” says Marilyne Andersen. The method is based on artificial intelligence. It is economical and reduces the carbon footprint. The rubble is first digitally scanned. A program then groups the identified materials and calculates how the individual pieces can be optimally reassembled, like puzzle pieces. Where necessary, gaps are filled using robotic concrete printers. The method also works for glass building envelopes. “The project tries to reuse material that has stood the test of time rather than demolish it and produce something new,” says Daniel Marshall. “It’s all about thinking realistically about some of the ways in which we construct.” The jury also appreciated the elegant and precise exemplifying design solutions presented along with the computational tool.
2nd prize: Alternative building blocks
Conventional brick production requires high temperatures and consumes enormous amounts of energy. The project by Daniel Francisco Gonzalez and Noor Shaikh from Waterloo and Toronto, Canada, proposes a sustainable production method for alternative, sustainably producible materials as insulation and wall veneer. The masonry elements are made of reclaimed cement-kiln dust and agro-industrial byproducts. Fish processing residue is used as a natural binder. The produced blocks will have different colors, weights, and textures depending on the materials used. Above all, production requires little energy. “Our model is based on circular economy,” explains Daniel Francisco Gonzalez. “We use byproducts from other industries as aggregates to produce new quality building materials. We are also reducing the amount of virgin materials needed in construction.” The jury considers this an elegant way of repurposing agro-industrial waste. It promotes the use of local resources, and the blocks being produced can be adapted to different regions of the world. “Even if it is always hard to establish such new building materials at a large scale, the use of waste material from agriculture and aquaculture is ingenious,” finds Marilyne Andersen.
3rd prize: Reduction of byproducts
Big Bend Power Station is a coal-fired power plant that pollutes and impacts Florida’s coastal environment. The proposed project will reduce the environmental impact of this power plant. Available material resources are used in concert to sequester carbon and better manage emissions. A network of bioreactors, open-pond farms, and constructed wetlands supports agricultural use and reduces the emissions. The system is embedded in an expansive wildlife reserve – a buffer and refuge for the local manatees. The jury finds the concept a clever and reproduceable idea to mitigate environmental problems. It aims to transform the area into an attractive landscape that combines nature, architecture, and infrastructure. “What is fascinating is that the project takes the existing and tries to make the most of it,” says Marilyne Andersen. “It tries to restore the old value and even give a new value on top.” Architect Samuel Clovis from Los Angeles hopes that the LafargeHolcim Awards prize will help in the further development of his idea: “I’m hoping that the momentum can help the transition from conceptional research to large-scale, real-world application of this technology.”
4th prize: Air cleansing
According to the WHO, urban air pollution is the greatest environmental threat to human health. Phoebe Mankiewizc, Ph.D. student at Yale University, proposes improving air quality by means of multifunctional plant-based air-cleansing systems. The systems metabolize air pollutants and help clean the air. They reduce the need for HVAC systems in buildings and therefore reduce energy consumption of buildings and promote human health. “The real potential is to implement this technology not only in corporate lobbies but also in communities that could really use them,” says the student. “The project is environmentally and socially sustainable. The maintenance could be taken over by community members to benefit the whole neighborhood.” The jury praises the integration of vegetation into a convincing modular system that has healthy effects on people and promotes ecological sustainability. “Plants can help in many ways,” says Marilyne Andersen, “and this project doesn’t just use them to make a building look green – it actually strives to change the comfort within a building.”

Under this agreement, the ERDC will provide technical assistance and $3.4 million to conduct a waste characterization study and develop a basic research program to demonstrate how C&D debris from across U.S. military installations may be used to create alternative fuels, and alternative raw materials for the production of new, more sustainable construction materials.
“In 2018, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimated that approximately 600 million tons of construction and demolition debris was generated in the United States, which is more than twice the amount of generated municipal solid waste,” said Sophie Wu, director, Geocycle North America. “The partnership with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will help us better understand this material and see how we can create a circular economy program leading to a zero-waste future.”
This research will utilize resources at Geocycle’s Holly Hill Research Center in South Carolina and Holcim Ltd.’s Global Innovation Center in Lyon, France. Geocycle, a provider of industrial, agricultural and municipal waste management services worldwide, works to develop new, innovative waste management techniques combined with proven ‘co-processing’ technology.
“We expect this partnership to lead to waste reduction opportunities at Army installations,” explained Stephen Cosper, an environmental engineer and project manager at ERDC. “We’re very excited about how this project can positively impact our military installations and our environment in the future.”
The research team will begin by conducting a waste-characterization study at a number of military installations facing significant construction and demolition debris. Construction materials will then be evaluated for possible co-processing opportunities, including energy recovery, mineral reuse, and mineral recovery. Information obtained as part of this research will help the USACE identify ways to reduce waste, increase its circular economy, and avoid landfill costs and associated emissions.
“In the U.S., LafargeHolcim’s sustainability goals are at the heart of our research agenda. While we are proud to offer some of the leading low-carbon, sustainable, building products in the market today, we want to make sure we develop the next generation of materials needed to reach our net-zero goal,” said Toufic Tabbara, CEO, US Cement at LafargeHolcim. “This partnership with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will help us identify solutions that can help drive the circular economy, reduce landfill waste, and lower our carbon emissions nationwide.”

Cemtech held its ‘Decarbonising the Cement Industry’ conference over Zoom on 20-23 September 2021, with attendees having the opportunity to hear from industry leading speakers spanning a range of fields linked to the sustainability of the cement sector. The challenge of moving to net zero remains a key consideration for the industry.
Cemtech’s virtual conference, Decarbonising the Cement Industry, opened on Monday, 20 September 2021 with around 2000 attendees from over 120 countries – a clear indication of the challenges facing producers to respond to new rules and regulations regarding decarbonisation, whilst also meeting stakeholder expectations.
Magali Anderson, chief sustainability and innovation officer, Holcim Ltd (Switzerland), reiterated the net zero pledge made by the company one year ago, while highlighting its global challenges. The launch of the ECOPact and ECOPlanet green products forms part of the company’s pledge and already a clear appetite is being seen with ECOPact accounting for more than five per cent of concrete sales in India alone in the first six months. The group is also actively working on more than 30 carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) projects across 12 countries.
Davide Zampini, Cemex (Switzerland), also took a reflective look at the progress made by the industry so far. In addition, he explained the company’s slogan, Future In Action, with a new target of 475kg of CO2/t of cementitious material by 2030, the LEILAC project, solar-driven cement pyro-processing in collaboration with Synhelion, its gravity energy storage system, and the future role of recarbonisation.
“Recarbonisation is a process that has been overlooked for many, many years. It is one of the key characteristics of the material, so I think there is going to be a lot of work to better understand what it means when concrete recarbonates. Also, research into understanding how do we accelerate that process, improve that process and take advantage of that process,” said Mr Zampini.
In his analysis of the global cement sector and CO2 solutions, Paul Roger of Exane BNP Paribas (UK) considered CCUS schemes and the impact that these technologies will have on cement prices, with potential increases of 26-70 per cent, and the future role of novel and blended cements. Although he predicts six per cent like-for-like EBITDA growth in 2022 for the world (excluding China), cost inflation is spiking more than expected.
Pathways to net zero
The afternoon session began with Jim O’Brien of CSR Consulting (Ireland) looking closely at the industry’s 2030 sustainability ambitions. When analysing the sustainability performance of 25 cement companies, which account for 1.66bnt of cement production, around 40 per cent of global output, he looked at how trends are changing in terms of alternative fuel usage, alternative materials, clinker/cement ratios, kiln thermal efficiencies and net CO2 emissions, highlighting which companies are ahead of the game and those who have a long way to go to meet their peers.
Peter Hoddinott, independent consultant, gave a personal look into the future of the cement industry by 2050, examining what impact carbon taxation will have on costs and pricing, as well as analysing the global market in terms of demand, industrialisation and urbanisation. Predicting a huge reduction in clinker capacity by 2050, he also examined the future availability of slag, fly ash, pozzolan, limestone, etc.
Heinz Telser of RHI Magnesita rounded off the opening day with an explanation as to why the challenges facing the refractory sector are not unlike those facing the cement industry as a whole. Calcination/sintering accounts for around 85 per cent of CO2 emissions in the refractory industry and although there are many measures and technologies already in place to reduce this, there needs to be a greater focus on the circular economy. RHI Magnesita has collaborated with Holcim at its plants in Austria and Switzerland for the use of its ANKRAL Q2 LC bricks. Its new low-carbon (LC) range are old refractories recovered from kilns, which are reconditioned and then used as a raw material to make new high-quality refractory products with a lower CO2 footprint.
The digital cement plant
Robert Feldmann, Microsoft, delivered a presentation looking at the new wave of digital sustainability applications available and their adoption by the cement sector. “[I] am super convinced, particularly now with the sustainability pressures, that this adoption will accelerate tremendously, and also the technology is now available,” he said. Microsoft’s Hybrid Cloud technology allows for the management of thousands of edge devices.
Chandra Rangapura Shettappa of Siemens (Germany) outlined the company’s SiCement Operations kiln forecast and closed-loop solutions. The platform can predict key parameters of the kiln, such as sintering zone temperatures, 15-30min into the future and generate early warnings about trends in the process. This can lead to a reduction in energy consumption, emissions and opex.
Karsten Horn, Inform (Germany), considered the CO2 emissions that could be saved by optimising the logistics of cement producers, while Berk Birand of Fero Labs (USA) noted that the usage of machine learning by the industrial sector would increase if it moves away from black-box thinking and becomes an explainable solution.
Co-processing and AF advances
A further session began with Matthias Mersmann, KHD (Germany), looking at the importance of co-processing in decarbonising cement and the company’s solutions for optimum alternative fuel (AF) utilisation. Continuing this theme, Sharmistha Nandi and Steffen Blume, Geocycle/GIZ (Germany), explored how pre- and co-processing is a well-established part of the production process in developed countries, but uptake in developing/emerging economies is slow. Therefore, GIZ, FHNW, Holcim and Geocycle have updated global guidelines to support environmentally sound and safe waste co-processing in developing countries, which can be a part of a larger waste management plan in the country.
Finally, Michalis Akritopoulos, Cinar (UK), presented how ‘advance fuel switching’ may be considered an interim alternative to the more expensive CCUS technology in combating carbon emissions. Trials of hydrogen usage in the kiln, alongside biomass and plasma in the calciner, are underway.
Clinker substitution
Michele Di Marino and Stefano Zampaletta, Cementir (Italy), presented Cementir’s low-carbon cement portfolio. Its futurecemTM technology allows more than 35 per cent of clinker substitution with limestone and calcined clay. By 2030 futurecem sales are expected to reach around 51 per cent of all its sales volumes in Europe.
Kavidasan Kalibaskaran of EcoOils (Malaysia) followed this by showcasing its eco-processed pozzolan (EPP) product, a building material that is used to compliment cement in the construction industry. EPP is processed from the waste of palm oil refineries and prevents it going to landfill.
Elsewhere, Pedro Ladeira of FCT Combustion (USA) highlighted the company’s calciner technology which is used to produce green cement.
Renewable energy and WHR
John O’Donnell, Rondo Energy (USA), explained that renewable electricity is now lower cost than gas and is getting cheaper every year. Rondo’s Heat Battery technology has been designed to store low-cost intermittent energy, such as that delivered by solar or wind power plants, and deliver 24/7 high-temperature process heat. It is building its first 20MW installation in 2022 and is looking to supply internationally from 2023-24.
Anna Kowalczyk, Enel Green Power (Spain), continued by exploring the concept of power purchase agreements (PPAs), which are contracts between a company and renewable energy supplier to purchase power at an agreed price. A PPA can be customised according to the energy consumer’s consumption profile and sustainability targets, while also hedging the company against long-term price risk.
Sabrina Santarossa, Turboden (Italy), looked at waste heat recovery through organic Rankine cycle (ORC) systems. The company has many reference projects in the cement sector, where heat is recovered from a variety of process sources to produce electricity.
Energy efficiency and grinding
Kaushik Ghosh, Köppern (Germany), began the energy efficiency and grinding session by presenting the company’s upgrades to the wear protection, hydraulic and feeding systems at a cement plant.
Laurent Guillot, Chryso (France), looked at how cement additives can optimise clinker content in limestone-based cement and maximise SCM content in composite cements.
Jeffrey Thomas, GCP Applied Technologies (USA), highlighted how its CO2ST® Reducers technology is designed to reduce the CO2 clinker factor in cement by up to 10 per cent. An industrial case study shows that, as emissions were reduced by 60kg/t of cement, this could result in a €1.7m/year saving with the ETS carbon price set at €50/t.
CCUS technologies
Daniel Rennie of Calix (France) detailed the developments seen with the LEILAC projects, which captures process CO2 without adding chemicals or requiring significant changes to the production process. The LEILAC2 demonstration plant in Germany is set to capture around 20 per cent of emissions while proving the low-impact retrofit approach of the company.
Glen Bailey, Carbon Clean (USA), noted that current estimates put the CCUS market opportunity for carbon capture at more than US$1trn with the company itself having around 40 operational units capturing 800,000tpa of CO2. It is also on a pathway to reduce the size of the units by a factor of 10 while cutting the cost of capture to around US$30/t by 2023. Key references include Holcim, Cemex and Dalmia.
Elsewhere, James Evangelou of Carbon8 Systems (UK) delivered a presentation looking at the company’s Accelerated Carbonation Technology which treats industry waste, such as bypass dust, using captured CO2 to create a low-carbon product. This solution results in zero waste, thereby reducing costs for the producer, permanently captured CO2 and a carbon-negative aggregate as an end product.
This article was first published in International Cement Review in November 2021.","In addition, he explained the company’s slogan, Future In Action, with a new target of 475kg of CO2/t of cementitious material by 2030, the LEILAC project, solar-driven cement pyro-processing in collaboration with Synhelion, its gravity energy storage system, and the future role of recarbonisation. When analysing the sustainability performance of 25 cement companies, which account for 1.66bnt of cement production, around 40 per cent of global output, he looked at how trends are changing in terms of alternative fuel usage, alternative materials, clinker/cement ratios, kiln thermal efficiencies and net CO2 emissions, highlighting which companies are ahead of the game and those who have a long way to go to meet their peers. In his analysis of the global cement sector and CO2 solutions, Paul Roger of Exane BNP Paribas (UK) considered CCUS schemes and the impact that these technologies will have on cement prices, with potential increases of 26-70 per cent, and the future role of novel and blended cements."
